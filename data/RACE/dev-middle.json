Don't be afraid. We must be brave. If you really want to learn English well, you must try to speak with everyone so long as he knows English. Whether you know him or not is not important. When there's nobody to talk with, you can talk to yourself in English. It's interesting and also a good way to practice your spoken English. Remember, the more you speak, the fewer mistakes you'll make.\nReading and writing are more important for senior school students. First we must choose the books we're interested in. A lot of reading will improve your language sense . This is the most important.\nKeep writing English diaries. We can also write English articles. You may even post them to English magazines.

People use them to cook food and to heat drinking water.\nThere are three kinds of sun-cookers. The first is a box cooker. It is designed with a special wall that collects sun-shine into the box. A box cooker is good for slow cooking of a lot of food.\nThe second kind of sun-cooker is a panel cooker. It has several flat walls that concentrate the sun-shine on the food. People can build panel cookers quickly. They do not cost much. In Kenya, for example, panel cookers cost just two dollars.\nThe third kind of sun-cooker is a parabolic cooker. It has rounded walls that concentrate sunlight into the bottom of the cooker. Food cooks quickly in parabolic cookers. However, these cookers are hard to make. They must be moved again and again to follow the sun. Parabolic cookers can also cause burns and eye injuries if they are not used correctly.\nYou can make sun-cookers from boxes or heavy paper.

My topic is \" _ \".\nNow in the 21stcentury, advertising is more and more important for people. Why? I think it is because through advertising, people, especially the businessmen, can introduce their products to the people all over the world. Because of this, many companies spend a lot of money on advertising. As we all know, there are many advertisements which are very interesting and popular. For example, Michael Jordan made an interesting advertisement for Nike. From this you can see how the companies make their products known to the world.\nPeople can make a lot of money through advertising. It is known that many famous singers and movie stars make money in this way. However, I don't think this is a good way for them to make money, because they are not the professional advertisers, especially those who advertise in medicine advertisements.\nNowadays, advertising not only means making the products known, but also means make ourselves known to people around us. Living today, we have to make people believe in us if we want to do important jobs. But how can this be done?

Or how hard it is to be among people laughing and not laugh yourself? Well, obviously it's because we have mirror neurons   in our brains.\nPut simply, the presence of mirror neurons suggests that every time we see someone else do something, our brains model after it, whether or not we actually perform the same action. This explains a great deal about how we learn to smile, talk, walk, dance or play sports. But the idea goes further: mirror neurons not only appear to explain physical actions,they also tell us that there is a biological basis for the way we understand other people.\nMirror neurons can undoubtedly be found all over our brains,but especially in the areas which relate to our ability to use languages,and to understand how other people feel. Researchers have found that mirror neurons relate strongly to language. A group of researchers discovered that if they gave people sentences to listen to (for example: \"The hand took hold of the ball\"), the same mirror neurons were _ as when the action was actually performed (in this example, actually taking hold of a ball).\nAny problems with mirror neurons may well result in problems with behavior. Much research suggests that people with social and behavioral problems have mirror neurons which are not fully functioning  . However, it is not yet known exactly how these discoveries might help find treatments for social disorders.\nResearch into mirror neurons seems to provide us with ever more information about how humans behave, communicate and spend time together. Indeed, it may turn out to be nearly the same important thing for neuroscience as what Einstein's theory of relativity   was for physics.

The results are similar, according to an article on February 7 in the Guardian, a famous British newspaper.\nIn one experiment, scientists told young children that they could either have a marshmallow  now, or two marshmallows in 15 minutes. Waiting obviously needed more willpower. Scientists then continued studying the children as they grew up. They wanted to see if some children always had stronger willpower. They also wanted to see how having stronger willpower affected their lives.\nYears later, scientists found that the children who had waited for two marshmallows were all healthier, happier and richer adults. Oppositely, the children who had shown weaker willpower at that young age were more likely to be in low-paid jobs, to be overweight, to have social problems.\nBut there is hope, Roy F Baumeister, an American social psychology  professor  told the Guardian. Baumeister says we can train our willpower just like we train our muscles.  Even a little practice can strengthen our overall self-control if we do it regularly.\nYou could start by making yourself stand up straight, speaking in complete sentences, or using a computer mouse with the other hand. Scientists have found that people who manage to change little habits often perform much better in laboratory willpower tests.\nLike muscles, willpower can 'get tired'.

Did you tell a joke that made everybody laugh? Give yourself praise for the good things you've done.\nGet rid of  fear Fear comes along with failure  . But it's easy to get over if you know that failure is a part of your life. Don't hide your head just because you said something foolish last time.

Life for the Nechita family is very different from what it was like a few years ago.\nAlexandra's father Niki left Romania for political reasons in 1985. At first he tried his best to learn English and had different kinds of low-paid jobs. In 1987, he brought his wife and Alexandra, who was then 18 months old, to America. The family was very poor. Alexandra began to draw at the age of three.\nShe was drawing for four or five hours a day. Soon people offered to buy her paintings and she had her first art show at the age of eight. Stories about this child appeared in the newspapers and television. They now live in a large house with a swimming pool.

Tom lives with his aunt Polly in a quiet street of St. Petersburg, Missouri. He's a lively and clever young boy, and he finds himself in many exciting adventures . He runs away with his friends, Huck Finn and Joe, to an island in the middle of the Mississippi River for several days. With Huck he goes looking for treasure, with Becky he gets lost in a cave and finally they find a box of gold.\nMy favourite scene in the book is when everyone thinks Tom is dead. He decides to go to his town funeral. He hides and watches for a time and then suddenly he appears. Everyone is surprised to see him but they're also pleased to see him alive.\nTom is the hero of the story, but there are another important characters. Huck is an outsider and everyone is afraid of him . Becky is pretty with fair hair, Joe is Tom's best friend and Injun Joe is the bad man of the story.\nThe theme of the story is about children growing up. It describes how strangers are seen in small towns of America. Finally, it talks about freedom, social rules and how people are punished for bad behavior.\nWhy do I think The Adventure of Tom Sawyer is a great book? Mark Twain wrote the story in 1876, but it's still read and loved by people all over the world today. And although it's only a story. Twain wrote it in the everyday English of the southern states of America in the 19thcentury, so it sounds very real. Today it's thought to be one of the greatest books in American literature.

With so many people downloading maps, sports videos, news and restaurant recommendations, you can get digital \"traffic jams\". Meanwhile, users are expecting faster and faster service.\nGoogle found that if one website is 250 milliseconds slower than another website, then people will visit it less often. This is why technology companies are now competing to be the fastest. Google said people do expect different things from different websites because they realize not all loading times are the same. For example, a person will be more patient waiting for a video to load than for a search result.\nEven so, four out of five online users will click away if a video takes too long to load. This makes it difficult for video websites to choose between the quality of pictures and fast loading times.\nTrying to get a higher speed has always been part of the history of the Internet. In the 1990s, when the World Wide Web first started to become popular, it was very crowded and slow; people called it the \"World Wide Wait\". But engineers managed to fight the problem with new inventions. They laid a lot of fiber optic cables  for sending in high speed; they improved software so it would work more smoothly; they placed computer servers all around the world to be nearer to users; all this increased speed.\nNowadays we can enjoy much faster Internet. Famous search engines such as Google and Microsoft's Bing usually find search results in less than a second. _ .", "id": "middle7097.txt"}, {"answers": ["B", "A", "D", "C", "C"], "options": [["heavy", "strong", "large", "thin"], ["one kind of ant", "all kinds of ants", "small ants", "large ants."], ["they can eat and kill elephants", "they can also eat wood houses", "they go in large groups", "they can even kill people"], ["They hide themselves under the ground.", "They have moved to other places before the ants come.", "They can be killed and eaten up by the ants.", "They were killed by people."], ["Ants", "American Ants", "A strong Ant", "Animals"]], "questions": ["Some ants in America can be very   _  .", "People and animals are afraid of   _   in America.", "People have to get away from the ants because   _  .", "Where are the insects or the snakes after the ants pass through?", "Which is the best title for the story?"], "article": "There are many kinds of ants in America.

As an adult you know what to do during a disaster, but what about the children? Some adults think it would probably never happen to them, so they don't teach their children what to do. Before it's too late, here are ways to help you prepare your child for a disaster:\nEducate: It is always good to let your child know about possible disasters. This doesn't mean children have to live in fear. When teaching them about disasters, keep the conversation positive by telling them there is a solution to the disaster. Keep the conversations short, allow for questions and answer honestly.\nPrepare: Always be prepared, that is the best advice for children. For example, when preparing for bad weather, get the tools you need, like candles, radios, food, water and medicine. Teach your child what is needed in certain disasters so that they know what is available for them, if ever needed.\nPlan: You should always have a plan for you and your child for any dangerous situation. Write out a simple list that they can read. The plan could start with \"listen to an adult's advice and/or call 119\".\nPractice: Once you have got the correct safety tools and worked out the right plan, practice every few months. Practicing what to do during a disaster with your child will help them if the time comes.\nDisasters can't be avoided but they can be lessened once you are prepared and ready for one.", "id": "middle7234.txt"}, {"answers": ["C", "B", "C"], "options": [["on a cold day", "on a rainy day", "on a hot day", "on a windy day"], ["he wanted to see their village", "he wanted to see the big city", "he felt very tired after a long walk", "he didn't want to go farther any more"], ["the frogs got to the big city", "it wasn't worth going any farther", "the frogs didn't see the big city at all", "the big city was just like their village"]], "questions": ["The two frogs went to see the big city   _  .", "One frog climbed on the other frog's back because   _  .", "We can infer that   _   according to the passage."], "article": "Two frogs had lived in a village all their lives.

In situations like this you should make a wise decision.\nYou can learn to deal with negative peer pressure. Keep away from people who try to influence your behavior in harmful ways. Though it is not always easy to say no, it's really necessary to learn to do that. Follow the following steps. First. look at the person and say no in a firm but polite voice. Make sure your face shows that you are serious. Let the person know you will not back down. Then, give reasons for saying no. Explain why you won't do what the person wants.

Indoor and outdoor rock climbing both need practice. What most people don' t know is that rock climbing is one of the sports that depend on your body and mind .\nTo climb successfully, one must use wonderful skills.

At most modern zoos people can see, smell and hear animals in their natural way. Some zoos even have \"friendship farms\" where people can touch some of the animals. Here are four reasons why people need zoos.\nFirstly, zoos educate people about animals and their natural environment. They give interesting information about each animal, such as where it comes from and how it lives. Special teachers at the zoo help children to understand more about the animals. Trained guides show visitors around the zoo.\nSecondly, zoos are working hard to find out more about animals. New knowledge leads to improved ways of looking after animals in the zoo, and better understanding of the same animals in the wild.\nThirdly, zoos play a part in protecting animals and stopping them from disappearing. Zoos work together with each other to help the animals in danger. For example, gorillas  from Taronga Zoo were sent to live with gorillas at the Melbourne Zoo in the hope that they would give birth to babies.\nFinally, zoos are important for people's enjoyment. People enjoy getting close to animals without having to cross the plains of Africa or climb the mountains of China. In the past, animal shows were common in zoos. Visitors were excited by monkeys in human clothes, and they even took rides on elephants or horses.

Schools must report any bullying at once, and they will be graded on how well they deal with the problem. New Jersey is one of 47 states with anti-bullying laws for schools. Only Michigan, Montana and South Dakota do not have such a law.\nThere are many kinds of bullying. It may include laughing at others, calling others names and leaving someone out. It can also be physical. The behavior happens over and over again, and can take place anywhere, from the playground to the Internet. It's reported that nearly half of all kids will experience bullying in school, and at least 10 percent are bullied regularly.\nEach year in October, many people begin to pay attention to bullying and try to do something to stop it. Many schools hold anti-bullying programs.\nWill stronger anti-bullying laws change the behavior forever? Ken Trump, president of the National School Safety and Security Services, says no. \"State anti-bullying laws do not provide more money, or other support,\" he said.

Post-it Notes, the pieces of paper that you can fasten almost anywhere and then remove without leaving any sign that they were there, are an example of such an invention.\nPost-it Notes were invented about twenty years ago by Art Fry, a scientist at 3M Corporation. The idea for the product came from a frustrating experience he often had while singing in his church choir. Fry used pieces of paper as bookmarks to mark the places in his book of songs, but these bookmarks were always falling out. He knew he needed a bookmark that would stay where he put it, but that he could remove without damaging the pages.\nAround that time, Fry heard about a new adhesive   that a workmate, Dr. Spence Silver, had created. This adhesive was special because it was sticky, but not too sticky. It was strong enough to hold papers together, but weak enough to not tear the paper when it was removed. Fry saw that the new adhesive could help solve his bookmark problem. One morning, Fry put some of the adhesive on the edge of a piece of paper. Just as he hoped, it made a perfect bookmark.\nA short time later, Fry realized that his new invention had even more uses than being a great bookmark. He came to this realization when he wrote a note on one of his new \"bookmarks\" and attached it to a report he was going to give to a workmate. Soon, co-workers were asking Fry for more samples of his invention so that they could use the new type of notes themselves.\nFry and some other people at 3M believed so much in the new product that they persuaded the company to give away thousands of the \"sticky pieces of paper\" for trial use . When some salespeople at 3M went to offices and showed workers just how helpful the new type of notes could be, they immediately received many orders.

A century after the accident, scientists have found something new to blame  for the sinking: the moon. Donald Olson, a Texas State University physicist, led a team of astronomers  to examine the moon's role, according to Reuters.\nNormally, icebergs stay in place and cannot move until they melt enough or a high tide  frees them. A single iceberg can become stuck many times on its journey southward. The process can take several years.\nAccording to Olson, a hundred years ago the moon made its closest approach to the Earth in more than 1,400 years. This caused the moon to have a much stronger pull on the Earth's oceans than usual, which created a super-high tide. The tide pushed icebergs from shallow waters off the coasts of Canada's provinces, Newfoundland and Labrador, into the Titanic's way.\n\"Of course, the final cause of the accident was that the ship struck an iceberg,\" Olson told Reuters. \"It went full speed into a region with icebergs, but thelunar connection  may explain how an unusually large number of icebergs got into the path of the Titanic.\"\nThe research team will publish their research in the April issue of Sky & Telescope magazine.\n,,.", "id": "middle511.txt"}, {"answers": ["B", "A", "D", "C", "B"], "options": [["It had a fire accident.", "It stopped half way.", "It was turned off by the writer.", "It moved fast up to the top floor."], ["more and more sacred.", "calmer and calmer.", "more and more bored.", "clearer and clearer."], ["The lift was to start again.", "The repair worker rang the lift alarm.", "The building was on fire.", "the writer pressed the lift alarm bell."], ["The writer.", "The writer's friend.", "The man.", "The writer's father."], ["escaped from a fire accident", "made a silly mistake.", "visited a dishonest friend", "pressed a wrong button."]], "questions": ["What happened to the lift?", "As the situation went on , the writer became   _   .", "Why did a bell ring from far away.", "Who most probably made the lift move again and go down to the ground to the ground floor?", "After reading the paper, the writer realized that he/she had    _   ."], "article": "I live on the twelfth floor of a building.

However, things went from bad to worse in March 2015 after heavy rains damaged the only power cables in the area. The villagers were forced to use oil lamps, which are not only expensive but also dangerous because of the harmful gases they produce.\nLuckily, researchers at the University of Technology (UT) in Lima, Peru heard about their problem and found a wonderful solution. They made a lamp that can be powered by plants and soil, both of which can be easily found in the Amazonian rainforest where the village lies. The lamp takes energy from a plant growing in a wooden box and uses it to light up an LED light bulb.\nWhile that may sound amazing and even impossible, the science behind the ides is quite simple. As plants create their food (using the sun's energy, water and chemicals from the soil), they also produce waste which they return to the soil. Tiny animals in the soil eat this waste and they produce electrons - the building blocks of electrical energy. The UT team put special sticks inside the soil to capture the energy and keep it in the lamp's batteries for later use. The researchers say a single charge can power a 50-watt Led light for two hours - enough time for local villagers to get their evening work done.\nThe university gave ten Plant Lamps to the villagers of Nuevo Saposoa in October 2015. So far, they have been a huge success! Elmer Ramirez, the UT professor who invented the lamp, believes the Plant Lamp could help improve the lives of many people, especially small rainforest communities, 42% of whom have no electricity.", "id": "middle7169.txt"}, {"answers": ["B", "B", "C", "D", "D"], "options": [["Saturday", "Monday.", "Thursday.", "Every day."], ["In the town.", "In the shop near her house.", "Near the shop.", "In different shops."], ["pears", "apples", "bananas", "oranges"], ["Fruit is good for people.", "Mr. and Mrs. Green like fruit a lot.", "Mrs. Green can buy all kinds of fruit.", "Mrs. Green only buys apples for herself."], ["the same", "cheap", "high", "not the same"]], "questions": ["When does Mrs. Green go to buy some fruit?", "Where does Mrs. Green buy fruit?", "Mrs. Green buys   _   for Mr. Green.", "Which of following is NOT right?", "In different time of the year, the price of each kind of fruit is  _  ."], "article": "Fruit is good for people.

When he went to college in Paris, he showed interest in looking through a microscope. A microscope makes things look a lot bigger; it lets you see things you can't see just with your eyes. Looking through a microscope, Pasteur found a living world in a drop of water. He saw and drew pictures of the small living things -- he called them \"microbes\" or \"germs\"-- that crowded in a drop of water.\nOne day a winemaker came into the lab, hoping that someone could help him with his problem. \"Sometimes my wine tastes delicious, but sometimes terrible,\" he said to Pasteur. \"Can you help me find out why?\"\nPasteur put some drops of the wine under the microscope. He noticed that the terrible wine had some unusual germs. If he killed these germs, maybe he could keep the wine from turning terrible. He tried with different ways to kill the germs. In the end he found heating   the wine seemed to work best. The winemaker tried it, and every bottle of wine tasted good.\nPasteur's idea worked for other people, too. When farmers heated milk, it didn't turn bad so quickly. When breweries heated beer, it tasted better. People called it \"pasteurization\" ---heating a liquid to kill bad germs.

During _ , trees provide a home for animals and produce oxygen  for the earth. And after people cut down the big trees, they plant small ones again.\nOften, a tree is not cut down for making paper at all. People use the big part for buildings.

Think of the movies, books, teachers, and friends that have affected you most deeply. They touched you because their creations were motivated by inspiration, not desperation. The world is changed not by those who do what has been done before them, but by those who do what has been done inside them. Creative people have an endless resource of ideas. The problem a creator faces is not running out of material; it is what to do with the material knocking at the door of imagination.\nStudy your role models, accept the gifts they have given, and leave behind what does not server.

He went to school in St. Albans--a small city near London. Although he did well, he was never top of his class. After leaving school, Hawking went first to Oxford University where he studied physics, then he went to Cambridge University where he studied cosmology. As he himself admits, he didn't work hard. He was a very lazy student, and did very little work. However, he still got good marks.\nIt was at the age of 20 that Hawking first noticed something was wrong with him. He started to bump  into things. When he visited his family at Christmas time, his mother was so worried that she made him see a doctor. Hawking was sent to hospital for tests. Finally, the result came back. Doctors said they had no way to help him. He would die before he was 23.\nAt first, Hawking became very sad, after a while, though, he began to see his life in a different way. As he later wrote, \"Before my illness was diagnosed , I had been very bored with life. There had not seemed to be anything worth doing. But shortly after I came out of hospital, I suddenly realized that there were a lot of worthwhile things I could do.\" Hawking married, found a job at Cambridge University, and had three children. He also went on to do some of the most important scientific research.\nToday, Hawking still works at Cambridge University as a professor.

Most readers know that his real name was Samuel Longhome Clemens, but how many know where the pen name \"Mark Twain\" came from?\nThe answer shows Clemens' colorful early life before he became a writer. \"Mark Twain\" was the cry shouted on a ship when the ship entered a part of a river that was two fathoms (6 feet) deep. \"Twain\" is an old-fashioned way of saying \"two\". Twain trained as a ship pilot on the Mississippi river for two years, a time that he wrote about in the humourousLife on the Mississippi (1883).\nThe famous river would become an important theme in many of his works--who could forget the journey of the Huck and Jim along it in his most famous book. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884)?\nWith little education, he had to teach himself how to write stories. Whenever possible, he would go to public libraries. There he spent much time reading and thinking, which greatly helped him with his writing.\nOn the other hand, his life experiences gave him wonderful material to write about and attract readers. Twain wrote in a style that has been called \"local colour\" because it shows great knowledge of local people and their customs.\nThis _ is very clear in the two books for which Twain is still celebrated today. The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and its follow-up The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, which many people call \"The Great American Novel\".\nThe most amazing invention in the book is the voice of Huck himself.

The purpose of it was to find out which of four kinds of temperaments they most had. From the questionnaire, scientists found that the students always answered something like \"My mood often changes for no reason.\"and \"I love to deal with new projects, even if it is risky.\"These answers were then matched with their birthdays.\nThey discovered that people born in summer easily change between sad and happy moods compared to people born in winter. Those who always feel positive are mostly born in spring and summer.\nThe study also found that those born in autumn less probably had a mood of _ which may easily drive them to cry, while those in winter were not easier to be angry.\nScientists said that this was probably because the seasons had an influence on certain chemicals in the human body.
