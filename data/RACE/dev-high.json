Why do they use pig and pork, cow and beef, and sheep and mutton? To find it out, we have to go back to 1066, when the Norman French invaded England and put a French king on the English throne  , which not only changed the government but also changed the language. French became the language of the upper classes of society. And it remained that way for 300 years. Only these high society people could afford to eat meat. As a result, French words like porc (pork) and beouf (beef) came into the English language. However, poor English farmers raised the animals. So the English language _ the words pig and cow from the Native Anglo-Saxon.\nThe Norman French added about 10,000 French words to the English language. Seventy-five percent of them are still in use today.\nIn French grammar, nouns have either a male or female gender  , so adjectives   take different forms for each. English has only one adjective that does this, and it came from French. The word \"blond\" describes someone with light-colored hair. \"Blond\" is used for men, and \"blonde\" describes women. And they are also nouns.\nSome French words that entered the English language have taken on completely different meanings. The French phrase \"a la mode\" means \"in style\". In English, the phrase means \"with the ice cream\". Someone must have decided something eaten with ice cream was in style!\nNow, as you learn English, you're on your way to learning French!", "id": "high6053.txt"}, {"answers": ["D", "B", "B"], "options": [["express his love for radio shows", "prove the popularity of the show", "show the influence of the hosts' words", "introduce the topic of the passage"], ["A boy eats his popcorn after watching the actor eat.", "A boy buys a Nike shirt when he finds his desk-mate has one.", "A girl unconsciously sits straight just as others do.", "A girl takes on the Yorkshire accent after a month's stay."], ["To draw readers' attention to popular radio shows.", "To introduce behavioral mimicry and its influence.", "To appeal to readers not to fall into others' habits.", "To advocate healthy food choices among readers."]], "questions": ["The author takes his own example of using \"good times\" to   _  .", "Which of the following is NOT an example of behavioral mimicry?", "What is probably the author's purpose of writing this passage?"], "article": "When I was a kid, I used to spend hours listening to Adam Carolla and Dr. Drew Pinsky on their Sunday night radio showLoveline.I listened so often that I began to use one of their well-known phrases--\"good times\"--in my daily conversations. Scientists have a name for this phenomenon: behavioral _ .\nYou've probably experienced this before: after spending enough time with another person, you might start to pick up on his or her behavior or speech habits. You might even start to develop your friend's habits without realizing it. There is a large body of literature concerning this sort of phenomenon, and it regularly happens for everything from body postures to accents to drink patterns. For example, one study found that young adults were more likely to drink their drink directly after their same-sex drinking partners, than for the two individuals to drink at their own paces.\nAnd the effect isn't limited to real-life face-to-face activities. Another study found that the same you-drink-then-I-drink pattern held even when watching a movie! In other words, people were more likely to take a drink of their drinks in a theater after watching the actors on the screen enjoy a drink. At least I don't feel so strange anymore, having picked up on Adam Carolla's \"good times\".\nNew research published today in the journalPLOS ONEindicates that the same sort of behavioral mimicry is responsible for social eating, at least among university-age women of normal weight. That's right: the young women were more likely to adjust their eating according to the eating pace of their same-sex dining companion.\nAs with most experiments, these results raise a whole new set of questions. Still, the finding that behavioral mimicry may at least partly account for eating behavior is important, and has real effects on health. The researchers note that \"as long as people don't fully recognize such important influences on intake, it will be difficult to make healthy food choices and keep a healthy diet, especially when people are exposed to the eating behavior of others\".", "id": "high1048.txt"}, {"answers": ["B", "C"], "options": [["to fill somebody's teacup all the way up", "not to fill somebody's teacup full", "not to fill somebody's teacup half way", "not to desire the guest to leave"], ["she disliked scorpions and lobster", "the service in the restaurants were not good enough", "she disliked that the things were brought live to the table", "she thought the food was not fresh enough"]], "questions": ["According to the author of the passage, it is the Chinese custom   _  .", "The author felt very uncomfortable during some of the dinners because   _  ."], "article": "Before I came to China, I had heard that, although North Americans eat more than Chinese, Chinese eat better. Since I have come to China, I have been able to experience these differences first-hand. A whole new world of food has been opened up to me.\n   Along with these new experiences came the quite unexpected introduction to the rituals  associated with eating. For example, shortly after arriving, I was gently criticized for filling somebody's teacup all the way up instead of half way. This was a signal to the person that I desired that he leave.\n   There may be mixed messages about what it means when you do something associated with food. But the fact is that there may be a message contained in the preparation, serving and consumption  of food in China. This was an idea that was totally new to me!\n   More than one Chinese has made the comment to me that they were unhappy with the results of inviting a foreigner to a meal. They told me that the foreigner was not appreciative of the meal that was served to him or her and was hard to please.\n   Having played the part of the foreigner at more than one Chinese  _ , I can understand where the misunderstandings come from. I myself have felt very uncomfortable during some of the dinners I have been invited to.\n   One time I was invited to a dinner in a famous restaurant in Tianjin. Its menu was based on seafood. I was still  ly new to the concept   that your fish would be brought live to your table. In Canada you are never introduced to your meal before hand. Something we don't like is considering what our food looks before the actual consumption.\n   However, having been in China for one year, I went along and helped point out some of the selections for the evening's meal. I hesitated at the scorpions , but swallowed my distaste and indeed found later that they were tasty.\n   The meal was winding its way  along without any problems. Then they brought out the lobster . I looked at it and then looked at it again and noticed that it was still moving! It had been brought out live to show that our raw lobster was indeed very fresh.\n   At that point, I nearly lost it. It took all my composure  for me to stay seated at the table and hurl  myself in the bathroom and bring up the contents of the previous dishes.  \n   Now the interesting thing is that when I tell that story to a foreigner, the reaction is always the same: Horror, sympathy, shock. When I tell the same story to Chinese, they don't understand my point of view.

On this solid foundation, the road builders placed paving stones.\nAlso, Roman roads were cambered. This means that they were built higher in the middle than on the edges, allowing rainwater to run off, which prevented flooding. We use the same technique in building roads today. The Romans also laid out roads over hills when necessary, setting them down in a zigzag pattern to make the road rise gradually.\nAll Roman roads had milestones  , placed every thousands paces (a Roman mile). The milestones told when the road was built, who was emperor at the time, the road's destination, how far the traveler was from the destination, and how many miles had been traveled since the beginning of the road. This information was a great help to travelers.\nBecause of their excellence in construction, it really is no surprise that many parts of Roman road still exist today.

He knew that without agriculture and natural resources, Singapore could only find a way out by developing itself into a place perfect for business. So he began with a few simple ideas: Singapore needed respect for elders and the law, hard work, and the idea that the needs of society are greater than the individual's.

If you can spare two or three hours a day, break them up into some periods to avoid brain getting tired.\nGo over each lesson several times, perhaps once in the morning, once in the evening and once several days later. Give your brain time to understand the material, but the break between periods of study shouldn't be too long, or you will forget most of what you've learned.\nMake sure you're comfortable with the bases of the language before learning the more advanced knowledge. Without full understanding of basic knowledge such as words pronunciation and spelling, you'll find it very difficult to learn more.\nSetting proper targets is a good way to encourage yourself. You could set yourself a time limit or aim for a certain level.\nOnce you have mastered the bases of the language, learn to apply them to the things that you're interested in. In this way you are more likely to remember the words, phrases and grammatical constructions you meet.\nYou will find that at times you're making rapid progress, while sometimes you seem to stand still or even go backwards. This is normal when learning a language, so don't be discouraged.\nMaking mistakes in a foreign language is nothing to worry about.

She noted that females may seek out males that are more colorful and better singers, or look to \"step up in the world\" and move to areas that are safer and have more food. \"Females are looking for the highest quality male so that their children will be of high quality,\" she added.\nProfessor Stutchbury said shorter summers may drive females to leave their nests before their young are fully grown up so they can quickly find new mates  and lay more eggs, leaving the males to feed the hungry chicks on their own.\nMales can double their success in producing children by fertilizing neighboring females, but only \"mates\" care for the young, and some are none the wiser. \"  They can't tell when the egg comes out and whether it's theirs or not,\" She said. \"They have no way to know.\"\nDivorce is surprisingly common among birds, and most live with one partner for only a few months or years. Divorce rates range from 99 percent in the greater flamingo to zero in the wandering albatross .", "id": "high11327.txt"}, {"answers": ["D", "D", "C"], "options": [["Because they are the best gifts for you.", "Because flowers all look beautiful", "Because different flowers smell good.", "Because they can express specific meanings."], ["roses of different colours show love to a girl.", "you can choose red rose at any occasion", "yellow rose is the best symbol for your love", "pink rose implies that your love comes to maturity ."], ["Carnation is better than rose", "Like the carnation, like the rose", "Different flowers have different meanings", "Flowers of different colours"]], "questions": ["Why do we choose certain flowers as gifts?", "In different stages of love,   _  .", "What does the passage mainly talk about?"], "article": "In Victorian times, certain flowers expressed meanings because the flower selection was limited. Therefore, flower as a gift was an effective tool in social communication. With so many choices today, we have no rules in flower choosing. However, people tend to give a certain flower their own personal meaning--- maybe it can remind them of some particular friends or events. Here I would introduce the traditional meanings of some gift flowers as a reference for your flower choosing.\nCarnation  is a good gift for your female teacher or mother, but not all kinds of carnations men respect and love. Different colours have different meanings. Generally, carnation means \"fascination and woman love\". Specifically, pink carnation means \"I'll never forget you\" and red carnation says \"I admire you\". But some carnations have very negative meanings. If you want to say goodbye to your girlfriend, you can send her a bunch of striped carnations or yellow ones, because it means \"Sorry I can't be with you. You disappointed me.\"\nRose is no doubt the best gift for girls in love. Basically, it relates to the love between men and women, but roses with different colours stand for different stages of love. Red rose is man's best friend when he wants to show his love to a girl. In the peak of his love, pink rose is more suitable because it means \"perfect happiness and please believe me\". While the love gets into trouble, yellow rose seems to be the best symbol. It means \"the decrease of love and jealousy\".\nThough you are free to choose any kind of flower as long as it is beautiful, I think this breif introduction can help you avoid making mistakes.

When my parents bought the house, in 1982, they were only two years older than I am now. I tried to imagine myself in two years, ready to settle down and buy the house I'd still be living in almost 30 years later.\n    It seemed ridiculous. On a practical level, there's no way I could afford to buy a house anytime soon. More importantly, I wouldn't want to. I'm not sure where I'll be living in two years, or what kind of job I'll have. And I don't think I'll be ready to settle down and stay in one place.\n    So this is probably the generation gap that divides my friends and me from our parents. When our parents were our age, they'd gotten their education, chosen a career, and were starting to settle into responsible adult lives.\n    My friends and I - \"Generation Y\" - still aren't sure what we want to do with our lives. Whatever we end up doing, we want to make sure we're happy doing it. We'd rather take risks first, try out different jobs, and move from one city to another until we find our favorite place. We'd rather spend our money on travel than put it in a savings account.\n    This casual attitude toward responsibility has caused some critics to call my generation \"arrogant\", \"impatient\", and \"overprotected\". Some of these complaints have a point. As children ,we were encouraged to succeed in school, but also to have fun. We grew up in a world full of technological innovation: cellphones, the Internet, instant messaging, and video games.\n    Our parents looked to rise vertically --starting at the bottom of the ladder and slowly making their way to the top, on the same track, often for the same company. That doesn't apply to my generation.\n    Because of that, it may take us longer than our parents to arrive at responsible, stable adulthood. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. In our desire to find satisfaction, we will work harder, strive for ways to keep life interesting, and gain a broader set of experiences and knowledge than our parents' generation did.  \nBy Ariel Lewiton", "id": "high22379.txt"}, {"answers": ["C", "B", "D", "D"], "options": [["was to play a joke on Rowan Atkinson", "disclosed the dark side of movies", "made the fans of Atkinson worried", "intended to destroy computer system"], ["Mr. Bean wasn't satisfied with Johnny English 3", "the producer decided not to use Mr. Bean in a film", "Mr. Bean failed to act well on the social platforms", "the audiences liked making fun of the famous comedian"], ["you will feel disappointed at the news", "you will be deeply hurt by the hackers", "your computer system will be changed in no time", "your personal information will be given away"], ["because he thought the news aimed to trick readers", "as soon as he read the news on his Facebook account", "after he had done a lot of research about the news", "when he was told that the news was false"]], "questions": ["The news that Mr. Bean committed suicide  _  .", "According to the rumours we can know  _  .", "When you open a link of fake news  _  .", "Ankit Aggarwal immediately removed the post  _  ."], "article": "If you come across the news of the death of Mr. Bean (actor Rowan Atkinson) on your Facebook account and you are curious to know more by opening a link, then think twice.

Judging from the experiment of Frederick in the thirteenth century, it may be. Hoping to discover what language a child would speak if he heard no mother tongue, he told the nurses to keep silent.\nAll the infants died before the first year. But clearly there was more than lack of language here. What was missing was mothering. Without good mothering, in the first year of life especially, the capacity to survive is seriously affected.\nToday no such severe lack exists as that ordered by Frederick. Nevertheless, some children are still backward in speaking. Most often the reason for this is that the mother is insensitive to the signals of the infant, whose brain is programmed to learn language rapidly. If there sensitive periods are neglected, the ideal time for acquiring skills passes and they might never be learned so easily again. A bird learns to sing and to fly at the right time, but the process is slow and hard once the critical stage has passed.\nExperts suggest that speech stages are reached in a fixed order and at a constant age, but there are cases where speech has started late in a child who eventually turns out to be of high IQ. At twelve weeks a baby smiles and makes vowel-like sounds; at twelve months they can speak simple words and understand simple commands; at eighteen months he has a vocabulary of three to five words. At three he knows about 1,000 words, which he can put into sentences, and at four his language differs from that of his parents in style rather than grammar.\nRecent evidence suggests that an infant is born with the capacity to speak. What is special about man's brain, compared with that of the monkey, is the complex system which enables a child to connect the sight and feel of, say, a toy-bear with the sound pattern \"toy bear\". And even more incredible is the young brain's ability to pick out an order in language from the mixture of sound around him, to analyze, to combine and recombine the parts of a language in new ways.\nBut speech has to be induced(,), and this depends on interaction between the mother and the child, where the mother recognizes the signals in the children's babbling ,grasping and smiling, and responds to them. Insensitivity of the mother to these signals dulls the interaction because the child gets discouraged and sends out only the obvious signals.

We don't realize that people in other places often get married in very different ways--and with different motives.\nIn many countries, marriage is a practical matter. A marriage provides a safe and stable home for the husband and wife. It also joins two families, which benefits the couple's parents and makes them happy. Marriage also brings children, making sure the couple will be taken care of in old age. Because marriage is important for the whole family, some cultures don't let young people choose whom to marry.\nJust as there are many different reasons for marriage, there are also many different wedding _ . Every culture has its own ways of bringing good luck to the happy couple. In a typical Western wedding, the bride seeks good luck by wearing \"something old, something new, something borrowed and something blue.\" Something old represents the past. Something new represents success in the future. Something borrowed reminds the bride she can get help from her friends and family. And something blue reminds her to be true to her husband.\nIn Poland, one wedding tradition is not only lucky, but also very practical. The wedding guests pin money to the bride's dress while she is dancing. The money is meant to bring luck and to help the young couple build their new life. In Bermuda, the young couple plant a tree in the yard of their new home. Once they move in, they take good care of the tree and make it grow.

At the beginning, it leaned to the southeast before the shaky foundation started to shift leaning towards the southwest. After the period of structural strengthening at the beginning of the 21stcentury, now the Leaning Tower of Pisa leans at an angle of 3.97 degrees.\nIn 1178, the shift in direction was observed for the first time when the construction had progressed further to the third floor. The tower was heavy for the three-meter foundation that was built on a weak area of land.\nFor compensating  the leaning position, the builders started to construct the upper floors with one side higher than the other one. This caused the tower to lean in the other direction. This unusual structure led to the tower being actually curved. In spite of these efforts, the tower kept on leaning.\nThe government of Italy started to plan prevention of the complete collapse of the tower in 1964. However, a request was put forward by the authorities to keep the leaning position because of the tourism industry of the region.\nAfter nearly two decades of careful planning by engineers, historians and mathematicians, the stabilization efforts for the Leaning Tower of Pisa started in 1990. The tower was closed for the general public and the people living nearby moved away. For reducing the total weight of the tower, its seven bells which represented the seven musical notes were removed. The tower was reopened for the general public on December 15, 2001.\nIn May 2008, after removing another 70 metric tons of earth, the engineers announced that the tower had been finally stabilized and it would remain stable for at least 200 years.", "id": "high14910.txt"}, {"answers": ["B", "C", "D", "B"], "options": [["where she has come from", "she was born on Saturday", "she was the first born daughter", "the happiness of the family"], ["Fara", "Mahira", "Malak", "Curitis"], ["Nearly 33% of the people wish they had been given a different name.", "All names can tell something about what happened when the baby was born.", "The child's name decides what kind of person the child will grow up to be.", "In some cultures, a child's name can tell where he or she has come from."], ["using numbers", "giving examples", "telling stories", "giving reasons"]], "questions": ["Ama is a name used to show   _  .", "Which of the following names means kindness and beauty?", "Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the passage?", "The writer develops the passage mainly by   _  ."], "article": "Children seem to care so much about their names.

The problem was not limited to New York. Unfortunately, there were too few uses for second-hand plastic.\nToday, one out of five plastic soda bottles is recycled in the United States. The reason for the change is that now there are dozens of companies across the country buying discarded   plastic soda bottles and turning them into fence post, paint brushes, etc.\nAs the New York experience shows, recycling involves more than simply separating valuable materials from the rest of the rubbish. A discard remains a discard until somebody figures out how to give it a second life -- and until economic arrangements exist to give that second life value. Without enough markets to take in materials collected for recycling, throwaways actually reduce prices for used materials.\nFewer landfill space and rising costs for burying and burning rubbish are forcing local governments to look more closely at recycling.

For every ton of waste recycled, a city avoids paying for its disposal (,), which, in parts of New York, amounts to savings of more than $100 per ton.

The 47-year-old from Hong Kong University was one of five women scientists, from each continent, to receive the 2011 L'Oreal-UNESCO For Women in Science Awards at a ceremony on March 3, at UNESCO Headquarters in Paris. It is the 13th edition of the award since 1998.\nYam's long and fruitful research on solving the energy problem won her the prize for Asia and the Pacific. There are several renewable and sustainable  energy solutions, like solar power, which could provide an unlimited source of energy. Some problems must be resolved, however, such as the low efficiency of solar cells and their high supply costs. Yam and her colleagues hope to overcome these problems by developing and testing new photoactive  materials.\nShe became the third Chinese women scientist honored with the so-called \"woman's Nobel Prize\" award, after Professor Li Fanghua from the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2003, and Professor Ye Ruyu from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2004.\n\"People think chemists are bad guys, but we are the good guys,\" Yam said in a humorous aside before explaining her research project on photoactive materials in an earlier speech at L'Institut de France. For Yam, chemistry is science, but also an art. Amazed by the universe, nature and color1 in her childhood, Yam decided on a career in chemistry. \"One of the beauties of chemistry is the ability to create new molecules and chemical species. I have always associated chemists with artists, creating new things with innovative  ideas,\" Yam said.\nAs a mother of two daughters, 12 and 14, Yam said she is lucky to have been supported by her family. She was inspired as a child by her father, a professor in the Civil Engineering Faculty at Hong Kong University. Yam added her husband, Mak Shingtat, a PhD in chemistry, who accompanied Yam to the awards ceremony, was also fully supportive of her work. \"I can't imagine how my career could move on without his understanding and support,\" she said. \"I often stay late at night in the laboratory. He always waits for me outside.\"\nYam received her bachelor and PhD degrees from the University of Hong Kong (HKU). She taught at City Polytechnic of Hong Kong before joining HKU as a faculty member, and headed the chemistry department for two terms from 2000 to 2005. At 38, she was the youngest member elected to the Chinese Academy of Sciences. She is also a Fellow of TWAS, the Academy of Sciences for the Developing World, and was awarded the State Natural Science Award and the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) Centenary Medal. 2011 is the 100th anniversary of Marie Curie's second Nobel Prize, coinciding  with the International Year of Chemistry. Today, Curie is still a role model for women in science.\nAlthough the participation of women in science, is promoted by UNESCO, notably through L'Oreal-UNESCO, there are still too few women doing high-level science, says UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova. The latest UNESCO report shows less than 40 percent of countries provide girls and boys equal access to education.\nEach year, the L'Oreal-UNESCO For Women in Science Award _ 15 young women from all over the world, especially developing countries, to encourage and finance their studies. More than 200 young women scientists are currently supported. \"I do not think there is a difference between men and women in terms of their intellectual abilities and research capabilities ,\" Yam said. \"As long as one has the passion, dedication and determination to pursue research wholeheartedly, one can excel regardless of one's gender or background.\"\nYam said some young women, who require stability and security, often have to give up their research because of family pressures. \"The only way for women to succeed in science is to get the mental and material support from family and society. There is a day-care center at my university, and my husband and mother-in-law help a lot with the housework, so I am able to spend my time on research,\" she said. \"I have two young daughters, and it is too early to tell whether or not they want to pursue careers in science. But, I will encourage them to always defend their ideas. To remain determined, and to never be afraid of failure - this is the advice that they will need to succeed in realizing their dreams.\" \nYam also acknowledged her colleague's support, at the awards ceremony. \"This (award) not only recognizes me, but my colleagues and students and my country, China.\"", "id": "high21158.txt"}, {"answers": ["B", "C", "B", "A", "C"], "options": [["Easy to Get your Visa", "Visa Information", "Enough Funds for Visa Application", "Importance to Get a Relative in the US"], ["the IAP -66 Form", "the I-134 Form", "the I-20 Form", "none of the above"], ["F-1 visa", "M-1 visa", "B-2 visa", "J-1 visa"], ["you have enough money for your study", "you have the ability to work there", "you have enough funds for one year", "your sponsor will support your study for one year"], ["The person applying for the visa can also fill out the sponsor form", "Non- s are more important in getting a visa.", "The government thinks  s are more reliable to act as a guarantee", "s are not allowed to ask someone else to fill out the form"]], "questions": ["What is the best title for the passage?", "If you want to get F-1 visa, you have to fill out   _  .", "If you want to pay a short visit to the States, you should get a   _  .", "To get a student visa approved, you have to prove that   _  .", "From the last sentence, we can infer that   _  ."], "article": "There are three types of student visas: F-1 (Student Visa), J-1 (Exchange Visitor Visa), M-1( Nonacademic Trade Schools).\nOf these, the F-1 and the J-1 are the most common for international students.

Its citizens are fundamentally prosperous and the way of life in the major cities and towns is much the same however many miles divide them. _ However, there is some difference in lifestyle between city dwellers and the country people. Almost 90 per cent of the population lives in the fast-paced cities along the coast and has little more than a passing familiarity with the desert. The major cities preserve pockets of colonial heritage, but the overall impression is modern, with new buildings reflecting the country's youth. In contrast, the rural communities tend to be slow-moving and conservative. For many years, Australia was said to have \"ridden on the sheep's back\", a reference to wool being the country's main money earner. However, the wool industry is no longer dominant. Much of Australia's relatively sound economy is now achieved from natural coal and wheat, and by being the largest diamond producer in the world. Newer industries such as tourism and wine making are also increasingly important. Australians are generally friendly and relaxed, with a self-deprecating sense of humor. On the whole, Australia is a society without hierarchies  , an attitude generally held to stem from its prisoner beginnings.\nYet, contrary to widespread belief, very few Australians have true prisoner origins. Within only one generation of the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788, Australia had become a nation of immigrants. Originally coming almost entirely from the British Isles, today one in three Australians comes from elsewhere. Australia's liberal postwar immigration policies led to an influx of survivors from war-torn Europe, most notably Greeks, Italians, Poles and Germans.\nThe emphasis has shifted in recent years and today the majority of new immigrants are from Southeast Asia.

Changes for the better, changes for the worse, changes that brought a lot of benefits to human beings, changes that put man in danger. Many things caused the changes, but, in my opinion, the most important was the progress in science.\nScientific research in physics and biology has vastly broadened our views. It has given us a deeper knowledge of the structure of matter and of the universe. It has brought us a better understanding of the nature of life and of its continuous development. Technology in the application of science has made big advances that have benefited us in nearly every part of life.\nThe continuation of such activities in the twenty-first century will result in even greater advantages to human beings; in pure science--a wider and deeper knowledge in all fields of learning; in applied science--- a more reasonable sharing of material benefits, and better protection of the environment.\nSadly, however, there is another side to the picture. The creativity of science has been employed in doing damage to mankind. The application of science and technology to the development and production of weapons of mass destruction has created a real danger to the continued existence of the human race on this planet. We have seen this happen in the case of nuclear weapons. Although their actual use has so far occurred only in the Second World War, the number of nuclear weapons that were produced and made ready for use was so large that if the weapons had actually been used, the result could have been the ruin of the human race, as well as of many kinds of animals.\nWilliam Shakespeare said, \"The web of our life is of a _ yarn, good and ill together.\" The above brief review the application of only one part of human activities--science seems to prove what Shakespeare said.

Well, many people travel because they want to see other countries and visit places that are famous, interesting or beautiful. People also travel to meet new friends, to try new kind of food, to experience life in other parts of the world or simply to get away from cold weather. Yet there are other reasons why people travel. Many of today's travelers are looking for an unusual experience and adventure travel is becoming more and more popular. Here is a quick look at two popular activities: hiking and rafting.\nHIKING\nHiking is a great way to travel. You will get close to nature and take exercise at the same time. Hiking is easy to do and doesn't have to be very expensive. You can hike close to home or travel to other places. The basic equipment you need for hiking is simple: good shoes, clothes and a backpack. You can hike in the mountains, in a forest or along a river. You can also go for a hike in the city.\nHiking is fun and exciting, but you shouldn't forget safety. Here are some basic tips for successful hiking: 1. Don't hike alone. 2. Tell someone where you are going; 3. Bring water and a good map; 4. Watch out for dangers, such as spiders, snakes, or poisonous plants; 5. Wear a hat to protect yourself from the sun; 6.Bring a mobile phone if you have one.\nRAFTING\nAnother exciting adventure is rafting. A raft is a small boat that you can use to paddle down rivers and streams. Rafting is a good way to experience nature. If you want a normal rafting trip, choose a quiet stream or river that is wide and has few trees and other dangers. The name \"whitewater\" comes from the fact that the water in these streams and rivers looks white when it moves quickly.\nAs with hiking, you should always think about your safety and wear good clothes. You also need to learn the basic skills of rafting, such as how to handle the raft, how to paddle and how to get in and out of the raft. You should not go rafting unless you know how to swim, and you should always wear a life jacket.", "id": "high8462.txt"}, {"answers": ["B", "B", "C", "C"], "options": [["It uses large amounts of fuel.", "It only flies at low altitudes.", "It needs a big landing field.", "It has a small gas tank."], ["The EMIEW2 robot.", "EMILY.", "XOS 2.", "The Martin Jetpack."], ["One.", "Two.", "Three.", "Four."], ["the Superhero Suit is designed for fun", "the EMIEW2 robot can tell different human voices", "Robo-Guard may serve as a security guard", "the AirPod car travels far with a little gas"]], "questions": ["What is the disadvantage of Glen Martin's invention?", "Which of the following inventions may be popular with modern companies?", "How many environment-friendly inventions are mentioned in the passage?", "From the passage we learn that   _  ."], "article": "Inventors are always looking for ways to make our lives easier, greener and a whole lot more fun.

He came and sat on the seat by the bus stop but he didn't look like he could have enough money to even ride the bus. After a few minutes he spoke, \"That's a very pretty car\". He was ragged   but he had an air of dignity   around him. I said, \"thanks,\" without taking a look at him.\nHe sat there quietly for a moment. The expected begging for money never came. As the silence between us widened something inside said, \"Ask him if he needs any help.\" I was sure that he would say \"yes\". So I asked, \"Do you need any help?\" He answered in three simple words that I shall never forget. The three words shook me. \"Don't we all?\" he said.\nI was feeling successful and important, above a bum in the street, until those three words hit me. Don't we all? I needed help. Maybe not for bus fare or a place to sleep, but I needed help. I reached in my wallet and gave him not only enough for bus fare, but enough to get a warm meal and shelter for the day.

The frequency with which it is borrowed mirrors a heated debate on environmental protection: whether to place wilderness at the heart of what is to be preserved.\nAs John Sauven of Greenpeace UK points out, there is a strong appeal in images of the wild, the untouched; more than anything else, they speak of the nature that many people value most dearly. The urge to leave the subject of such images untouched is strong, and the danger exploitation  brings to such landscapes  is real. Some of these wildernesses also perform functions that humans need--the rainforests, for example, store carbon in vast quantities. To Mr.Sauven, these \"ecosystem services\" far outweigh the gains from exploitation.\nLee Lane, a visiting fellow at the Hudson Institute, takes the opposing view. He acknowledges that wildernesses do provide useful services, such as water conservation. But that is not, he argues, a reason to avoid all human presence, or indeed commercial and industrial exploitation. There are ever more people on the Earth, and they reasonably and rightfully want to have better lives, rather than merely struggle for survival. While the ways of using resources have improved, there is still a growing need for raw materials, and some wildernesses contain them in abundance. If they can be tapped without reducing the services those wildernesses provide, the argument goes, there is no further reason not to do so. Being untouched is not, in itself, a characteristic worth valuing above all others.\nI look forwards to seeing these views taken further, and to their being challenged by the other participants. One challenge that suggests itself to me is that both cases need to take on the question of spiritual value a little more directly. And there is a practical question as to whether wildernesses can be exploited without harm.\nThis is a topic that calls for not only free expression of feelings, but also the guidance of reason. What position wilderness should enjoy in the preservation of the world obviously deserves much more serious thinking.", "id": "high394.txt"}, {"answers": ["D", "C", "D"], "options": [["Doing more exercises every day.", "Taking time to visit friends regularly.", "Stopping making bed occasionally.", "Doing what you want to do first."], ["Most people do not take care of their health.", "Most people put others' needs ahead of their own.", "Most people cannot keep balance on managing time.", "Most people do not take time to relax themselves."], ["Matter - of - fact.", "Negative.", "Indifferent.", "Worried."]], "questions": ["What is the solution to the problem of managing time?", "What is the major problem of most people managing time?", "What is the author's attitude toward people's problems in the passage?"], "article": "A patient came to see me about the stress in her life.

However, she went along with my idea.\nTwo weeks later she went into my office beaming.

Melting snow provides water for rivers, electric power centers and agricultural crops. In the western United States, mountain snow provides up to 75% of all surface water supplies.\nSnowfall helps to protect plants and some wild animals from cold, winter weather. Fresh snow is made largely of air trapped among the snow crystals. Because the air has trouble moving, the movement of heat is greatly reduced.\nSnow also is known to influence the movement of sound waves. When there is fresh snow on the ground, the surface of the snow takes in, or absorbs, sound waves. However, snow can become hard and flat as it becomes older or if there have been strong winds. Then the snow's surface will help to send back sound waves. Under these conditions, sounds may seem clearer and travel farther.\nGenerally, the color of snow and ice appears white. This is because the light we see from the sun is white. Most natural materials take in some sunlight. This gives them their color. However, when light travels from air to snow, some light is sent back, or reflected. Snow crystals have many surfaces to reflect sunlight. Yet the snow does take in a little sunlight. It is this light that gives snow its white appearance.\nSometimes, snow or ice may appear to be blue. The blue light is the product of a long travel path through the snow or ice. In simple terms, think of snow or ice as a filter. A filter is designed to reject some substances, while permitting others to pass through. In the case of snow, all the light makes it through if the snow is only a centimeter thick.

Peer pressure, media influence, and personal expression are some of the common reasons for wearing tattoos today.\nThe desire to be accepted by one's friends or peers can have a great influence on what a person does. Sometimes, wearing a tattoo can be a sign that you belong to a certain group. Gangs often use special clothes and tattoos to identify their particular group. Some of these groups wear only brand-name clothes. Others wear tattoos. When a person's friends are all doing something, that person is more likely to do the same thing.\nThe media is another big influence behind the popularity of tattoos in North America. A wide variety of media images show tattoos--people appearing in commercials selling expensive cars, famous sports heroes with tattoos in magazines, fashion models wearing designer clothes that show their bodies tattooed with detailed and colorful patterns. These media images link tattoos to ideas of wealth, success, and status. As a result, many people decide to get a tattoo for its fashion and status value.\nMany people decide to wear tattoos in order to express their artistic nature, their beliefs, or their feelings-in other words, to show their individuality . A musician in a rock band may get a tattoo of a guitar on the arm. Some environmentalists may tattoo pictures of endangered animals on their shoulders. A tattoo can be a public sign to show what is important in a person's life.\nAs you can see, there are many reasons why young North Americans get tattoos. A tattoo can be part of a group's uniform, a sign of fashion, or an expression of individuality. The decision to get a tattoo is most often a result of the influence of friends or media or the desire to express oneself.

In love, at least, the silent, withholding type is not always the most powerful. \"The strongest one in a relationship is often the person who feels confident enough to talk about their feelings,\" says educational psychologist Ingrid Collins. Psychosexual therapist Paula Hall agrees. \"The one with the upper hand is often the person who takes the initiative.\" In fact, the person who says \"I love you\" first may also be the one who says  \"I'm bored with you' first.\" Hall believes that much depends on how \"I love you\" is said and the motivation of the person saying it. Is it said when they're drunk? Is it said before their partner flies off on holiday, and what it really means is \"Please don' t be unfaithful to me\" ? By saying \"I love you\", they are really saying \"Do you love me?\" If so, wouldn't it just be more honest to say that.

Some blame the jams on the two-year-old policy that allows cars with no more than seven seats to use the highways for free on public holidays, but a Beijing News editorial said this is not the real cause of the jams.\nThe growing automobile culture is doubtlessly among the causes. Data shows that China's production and sales of automobiles both went up by 20 million in 2013. But over the same period there has been no breakthrough in highway construction, and _ \nGrowing tourism also leads to the jams. At the 2014 global summit of the World Travel and Tourism Council, which ended last week, it was reported that Chinese people spent almost 3 trillion yuan on tourism in 2013, which took up more than 90 percent of hotel income and more than 80 percent of air and railway use.\nWorse, Chinese have to travel during the same periods. As employees' rights to paid leave often fail to be protected, many have no choice but to travel on the limited public holidays. From Oct 1 to 7, the so-called Golden Week, almost every tourist site will be full of visitors. Therefore it is wrong to blame the free-pass policy.\nThat does not mean the government should stand idle doing nothing. As traffic jams during the holidays are predictable, they could develop more public transport and strengthen legal supervision to ensure that every employee enjoys their entitlement to a paid vacation or offer free passes on other days to encourage people to travel on days other than public holidays.

People have not enough time with their family.\nIt is evident that the causes of this phenomenon are different. In the first place, advancing in technology improves the efficiency of production, but also causes people to do more things at the same time.

Besides, employees may be scattered at the whole world.

People do not have enough time to spend with their family, especially with their children. They may spend much time in front of TV or computer games which have much violence and may seriously influence children's growth. Furthermore, the increasingly over-speed lifestyle will engender a higher incidence of illness.

Samuel Mehr, the leading researcher of the new study, said it is wrong to think that learning to play a musical instrument improves a child's intellectual development. The evidence comes from studies that measured the mental ability of two groups of 4-year-olds and their parents. One group attended music class; the comparison group went to a class that places importance on the _ arts-arts that can be seen.\n\"We found no evidence for any advantage on any of these tests for the kids participating in these music classes,\" said Mehr.\nSamuel Mehr says researchers have carried out many studies in an effort to learn whether musical training can make children smarter. Only one study seems to show a small percentage increase in IQ, intellectual scores among students after one year of music lessons.\nHe does not believe that IQ is a good measure of a child's intelligence. Therefore, the researchers in his study compared how well children in the musical training group did on mental processing tasks, then the results were compared to those of children who did not take lessons.\nMusic lessons may not offer children a fast easy way to gain entry to the best schools later of their life, but the training is still important.\nMr Mehr notes that the works of writer William Shakespeare are not taught , so the children will do better in physics.

In a letter addressed to the justice secretary, Ken Clarke, 40 archaeologists write of their \"deep and widespread concern\" about the issue. It centers on the law introduced by the Ministry of Justice in 2008 which requires all human remains unearthed in England and Wales to be reburied within two years, regardless of their age. The decision means scientists have too little time to study bones and other human remains of national and cultural significance.\n\"Your current requirement that all archaeologically unearthed human remains should be reburied, whether after a standard period of two years or further special extension, is contrary to basic principles of archaeological and scientific research and of museum practice,\" they write.\nThe law applies to any pieces of bone uncovered at around 400 dig sites, including the remains of 60 or so bodies found at Stonehenge in 2008 that date back to 3,000 BC. Archaeologists have been granted a temporary extension to give them more time, but eventually the bones will have to be returned to the ground.\nThe arrangements may result in the waste of future discoveries at sites such as Happisburgh in Norfolk, where digging is continuing after the discovery of stone tools made by early humans 950,000 years ago. If human remains were found at Happisburgh, they would be the oldest in northern Europe and the first indication of what this species was. Under the current practice of the law those remains would have to be reburied and effectively destroyed.\nBefore 2008, guidelines allowed for the proper preservation and study of bones of sufficient age and historical interest, while the Burial Act 1857 applied to more recent remains. The Ministry of Justice assured archaeologists two years ago that the law was temporary, but has so far failed to revise it.\nMike Parker Pearson, an archaeologist at Sheffield University, said: \"Archaeologists have been extremely patient because we were led to believe the ministry was sorting out this problem, but we feel that we cannot wait any longer.\"\nThe ministry has no guidelines on where or how remains should be reburied, or on what records should be kept.", "id": "high6396.txt"}, {"answers": ["A"], "options": [["Fans may raise their noise levels to cheer their teams up.", "Brazil will win because of its strong ability.", "It is a waste of time and effort for countries to hold sports games.", "The visiting teams have a good chance of winning."]], "questions": ["What can be inferred from the passage?"], "article": "In 2010, 700 million people huddled together in front of their television sets to watch the World Cup final between the Netherlands and Spain.

Brazil are the runaway favourites to win the tournament, with bookmakers offering odds of less than three to one on the home team winning the championship.Many experts agree that the country will benefit from a strong home advantage, as local crowds roar on the Seleqao.How much does playing on home turf fealty affect a team's performance?\nSports scientists have come up with all sorts of theories to explain why playing at home helps. In 2007 a study investigated the influence of crowd noise on referees in the English football Premier League. It showed that _ were more likely to flash yellow cards and award penalties against touring players than the hosts, because they relied on the split-second rise in the home crowd's roar as a reminder to determine if a tackle deserved punishment. In the most recent season of the Spanish football Riga, two-thirds of all penalty kicks were awarded to the home team.\nIn the latest English football season, the top 20 clubs enjoyed a home success rate of 50%, while their victory rate on the road was 32%. In 12 of the past 19 World Cups the host nation has made it to the semi-finals and six times it has gone on to win. The effect can be seen in other sports too. _ Before the start of the London Olympics in 2012, UK Sport, a government agency, studied the results of more than 100 big tournaments across 14 Olympic sports. _ As it turned out, Britain bettered its 2008 performance by winning 18 more medals(10 of them gold), an improvement of 38% _ At the Beijing games, China won 59% more medals than it had done at the 2004 Athens games. _ Russia topped the medal table in Sochi:in the previous winter Olympics it had come sixth.\nGiven these numbers, it is not surprising that teams have poured money into maximizing their home advantage. For example, Brazil has spent a considerable fortune on, if somewhat leisurely, a programme of stadium construction and renovation. In all its home advantage is worth the equivalent of a 0.6-goal headstart in every match, according to Goldman Sachs, an investment bank.

For decades, scientists have pumped electricity into piezoelectric materials for use in environmental sensors, speakers and other devices.\nOver the past few years, however, scientists have made dramatic advances in getting electricity out of piezoelectric devices. In an experiment, by using sound waves, which at 100 decibels were not quite as loud as a rock concert (a normal conversation is about 60-70 decibels), the South Korean scientists produced a mild electrical current of about 50 millivolts .

He lay on a hard little bed and struggled to start breathing.\nOliver fought his first battle without much assistance from the two people present at his birth. One was an old woman, who was nearly always drunk, and the other was a busy local doctor, who was not paid enough to be very interested in Oliver's survival.  _ \nHowever, Oliver managed to draw his first breath, and then announced his arrival to the rest of the workhouse by crying loudly. His mother raised her pale young face from the pillow and whispered, \"Let me see the child, and die.\"\nThe doctor turned away from the fire, where he had been warming his hands. \"You must not talk about dying yet,\" he said to her kindly. He gave her the child to hold. Lovingly, she kissed the baby on its forehead with her cold white lips, then stared wildly around the room, fell back--and died. \"Poor dear!\" said the nurse, hurriedly putting a green glass bottle back in the pocket of her long skirt.\nThe doctor began to put on his coat. \"The baby is weak and will probably have difficulties,\" he said. \"If so, give it a little milk to keep it quiet.\" Then he looked at the dead woman. \"The mother was a good-looking girl. Where did she come from?\"\n\"She was brought here last night,\" replied the old woman. \"She was found lying in the street. She'd walked some distance, judging by her shoes, which were worn to pieces. Where she came from, where she was going to, or what her name was, nobody knows.\"\nThe doctor lifted the girl's left hand. \"The old story,\" he said sadly, shaking his head. \"No wedding ring, I see. Ah! Good night.\"\nAnd so Oliver was left with only the drunken nurse. Without clothes, under his first blanket, he could have been the child of a king or a beggar. But when the woman dressed him later in rough cotton clothes, yellow with age, he looked exactly what he was--an orphan in a workhouse, ready for a life of misery, hunger, and neglect.\nOliver cried loudly. If he could have known that he was a workhouse orphan, perhaps he would have cried even more loudly.\nThere was no one to look after the baby in the workhouse, so Oliver was sent to a special \"baby farm\" nearby. There, he and thirty other children rolled around the floor all day, without the inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing. Mrs Mann, the old woman who \"looked after\" them, was very experienced. She knew what was good for children, and a full stomach was very dangerous to their health. She also knew what was good for herself, so she kept for her own use the money that she was given for the children's food. The board responsible for the orphans sometimes checked on the health of the children, but they always sent the beadle, a kind of local policeman, to announce their visit the day before. So whenever the board arrived, of course, the children were always neat and clean.\nThis was the way Oliver was brought up. Consequently, at the age of nine he was a pale, thin child and short for his age. But despite frequent beatings by Mrs Mann, his spirit was strong, which was probably the reason why he managed to reach the age of nine at all.\nOn Oliver's ninth birthday, Mr Bumble, the beadle, came to the house to see Mrs Mann. Through the front window Mrs Mann saw him at the gate, and turned quickly to the girl who worked with her.\n\"Quick! Take Oliver and those others upstairs to be washed!\" she said. Then she ran out to unlock the gate which was always kept locked.", "id": "high11521.txt"}, {"answers": ["C", "D", "C"], "options": [["she liked umbrellas very much", "the umbrella reminded her of her life in the UK", "she had got used to the changeable weather in Britain", "it often rained in Japan those days"], ["She didn't like Japanese culture any more.", "The Japanese behaviour had changed a lot.", "The world in Japan was too small for her.", "She had got used to British culture and life."], ["Why not make friends with the British", "Cultural differences between Britain and Japan", "Culture shock experienced by a Japanese student", "How to prepare for culture shock"]], "questions": ["The reason why Mami had the habit of carrying an umbrella was that   _  .", "Why did Mami experience culture shock in Japan?", "The best title for the passage would be \"  _   \"."], "article": "A Japanese student called Mami told me about her own experiences in Britain.

But why should it be any different? Being young persons in America, shouldn't they take up all of the challenges and opportunities that this country offers?\nConsider some of these views shared in the Slate story: Jennifer, 29, owner of a two-bedroom apartment with her husband, worries that she won't be able to have children for at least a decade because they can't afford to buy a house yet.\nI read that, and I thought, what planet is she living on where you need to own a house in order to have kids? Has she ever visited a developing country, or even downtown areas in this one? Home ownership is a luxury , not a fertility requirement.\nA 26-year-old in the story despairs that he can't afford to get a Ph.D. in literature. Well, that sounds a bit like expressing disappointment that no one will pay you to write poetry on the beach in Thailand for five years.\nYes, it's sad that these young people feel so lost. But I think the problem is their extremely high expectations, not economic reality. Beth Kobliner, author of Get a Financial Life: Personal Finance in Your Twenties and Thirties, says that she thinks people's expectations are slowly adjusting, but today's 20-somethings grew up at a time when everyone's wealth appeared to be expanding. Their parents probably saw their home values rise along with their investments. \"So you have people who have grown up in an environment where people had great expectations of what living well means,\" says Kobliner.\nThis recession will certainly play a role in forcing those expectations into more realistic group. In the meantime, it seems a lot better for our mental health to focus on being grateful-for our one-bedroom apartments, for living in modern cities, or perhaps just for being able to eat three meals a day-than on longing for some kind of luxury life.", "id": "high19344.txt"}, {"answers": ["D", "B", "A", "C"], "options": [["the greatest detective who ever lived", "Dr Joseph Bell", "Arthur Conan Doyle", "only a character made up by Arthur Conan Dolye"], ["tall and learn", "lovable but always clumsy", "lovable but sometimes clumsy", "lovable and never clumsy"], ["with Dr Watson", "with Dr Joseph Bell", "with the greatest detective", "with Doyle"], ["from his own imagination", "based on a famous London doctor", "based on Dr Joseph Bell at Edinburgh University", "based on a model of Holmes"]], "questions": ["Sherlock Holmes was  _  .", "Dr Watson was  _  .", "Holmes was supposed to have lived  _  .", "Doyle made up the description of Holmes  _  ."], "article": "Sherlock Holmes is considered by many people as the greatest detective in fictional literature.

Doyle gave Holmes' address as 221-B Baker Street, London, and to this day some visitors to London still go to Baker Street to search for 221-B. Of course, there never was really any such address.

Sherlock Holmes first appeared in Doyle's A Study in Scarlet published in 1887. Holmes was so loved by all that when his author killed him off in one of his stories, readers wrote in anger to complain. They refused to allow Holmes to die!

This may include exercise classes, mud baths, body treatment, facials  , etc.\nIn Japan, traditional hot springs have attracted visitors for centuries. And thermal baths   have been found in the ruins of the Cretan Palace of Knossos (2000-1400 B.C.). It was the Romans who made spas popular in Europe. They established a number of towns around thermal waters. These include the English town of Aquae Sulis (which is called Bath today), and the Belgian town of Aquae Spadanae (which is known as Spa these days).\nIn the 18\ncentury, spas became the fashionable places to go on holiday. Bath and Harrogate in the UK were popular with British rich people. And in Europe Carsbad (now called Larlovy Vary), Marienbad and Franzensbsf were Europe's most important holiday centers.\nA typical day in Carsbad in the 19\ncentury went as follows. Visitors got up at 6:00 a.m. to take the waters and listen to music by a band. Next, came a light breakfast, a bath in the waters, and then lunch. In the afternoon, visitors went sightseeing, walked or attended concerts. After dinner, there were theatrical performances. Guests returned to their hotels at about 9 p.m. to rest until six the following morning. Visitors would stay for as long as a month. Some of the more famous patients at these spas included the composers Beethoven and Chopin, and the Russian writer Turgnev.\nMarienbad was the best spa town.

Many headmasters have conducted workshops explaining such matters as the reading readiness, program writing and mathematics to parents.\nMoreover, the classroom teacher, with the permission of the supervisors , can also play an important part in giving more knowledge to reporting pupils progress, teachers can help parents a lot in educating their children and parents can give much help to teachers.\nSuppose that a father has been drilling Junior arithmetic lessons night after night. In a friendly talk between the teacher and the father, the teacher can help the parent to make Junior interested in it. He might be persuaded to let Junior join in discussing the family budget, buying the food, using a ruler or measuring cup at home, setting the clock, calculating the distance of a trip and engaging in scores of other activities that have a mathematical basis.\nIf the father follows the advice, it is reasonable to say that he will soon realize that his son is making satisfactory progress in mathematics, and at the same time, enjoying the work.\nToo often, however, teachers' talks with parents are devoted to small accounts of children's misdemeanors . They talk about the laziness and poor work habits of the children.\nWhat is needed is a more creative way in which the teacher, as an adviser, plants ideas in parents' minds to make sure that the child spends the many hours out of the classroom learning something useful.\nIn this way the school and the home join forces in educating children.", "id": "high15329.txt"}, {"answers": ["D", "D", "B"], "options": [["kids are afraid of Halloween", "Halloween brings people no fun", "kids are involved in criminal offences", "Halloween night puts some kids at risk"], ["put an end to trick or treat", "control anti-social behaviours", "punish those who frighten others", "make Halloween safe trouble-free"], ["ask people to respect the elderly.", "make some people free from harm", "warn little kids to behave themselves", "express disagreement with Halloween"]], "questions": ["The study made by Safe kids Worldwide has found that   _  .", "British police forces are making efforts to   _  .", "\"Sorry, No Trick or Treat \" posters are designed to  _  ."], "article": "Lots of people like a good fright at Halloween .

Because of coffee's need for shade and its ability to be grown alongside other crops, the small coffee trees didn't require any forests to be cleared.\nBut this took a bad turn in 1970 when US agricultural scientists decided to develop a new coffee plant that grew only in the full sun.

Dr. Mann conducted two studies. In the first experiment, 40 people were asked to carry out a boring task. They were told to copy numbers out of a telephone directory for 15 minutes. After that they were asked to complete another task. A pair of cups were given to each of them. Everyone tried to come up with different uses of the cups, and was given a chance to display their creativity. Meanwhile, another group of 40 people were just asked to come up with uses for the cups without doing any boring tasks before. It turned out that the 40 people who had first copied out the telephone numbers were more creative than the control group .\nTo see if daydreaming was a factor in this effect, a second boring task was introduced that allowed even more daydreaming than the boring writing task. This second study saw 30 people copying out the numbers as before, but also included a second group of 30 reading rather than writing them.\nAgain the researchers found that the people in the control group were least creative, but the people who had just read the names were more creative than those who had to write them out. This suggests that more passive boring activities, like reading or perhaps attending meetings, can lead to more creativity. Compared with reading, writing reduced the scope  for daydreaming.

Have you wondered why? The reasons are simple and important to the way you see the rest of your world.\nYour eyes are like two small cameras. A camera catches an image of an object and records it on film. Similarly, when you look at something, each eye takes in what it sees and sends this image to the back of the eyeball. Because your eyes are set close together, they view the world from about the same height but from slightly different angles. Working as a team, the eyes send the images to your brain, which puts them together into a single, centered image.\nSeeing in stereo means seeing with two eyes working together, which is called stereoscopic sight. This allows you to view the world in three dimensions, or 3-D. Seeing depth helps you to judge the distance between you and the objects you see and to adjust to the changing angle at which you see something as you move closer to or farther away from it. If images are coming from only one eye, however, only two of these dimensions----height and width----can be _ . A world seen with one eye is thus two-dimensional, as in a photograph.\nNow consider why your two eyes are on the front of your face. Think of other animals with the same arrangement. They are all animals that hunt, like lions and wolves. Their eyes face directly in front of them. This provides a field of sight about 180 degrees wide, which is called binocular  sight. On the other hand, animals that are hunted have eyes on the sides of the head, which provides nearly360-degree field of sight. In order to stay alive, they need to see things coming from the sides and from behind. However, without stereoscopic sight, they have difficulty determining how far a danger is.\nWith sight both stereoscopic and binocular, humans share with animal hunters the ability to see from side to side and to accurately determine the distance. If you think it would be great to have another type of sight, perhaps with hundreds of tiny eyes like many insects do, think again! Each tiny insect eye sees only a tiny part.

Five years ago, researchers found an area in the Atlantic Ocean seabed, where a part of the Earth's outer layer, or crust , is  missing. A thick layer of dark green rock, which is usually found deep inside the planet, lies exposed.\nThe crust, mantle  and core  are the main layers that make up the planet. The mantle rests between the crust and the core.\nLast month, a team of 12 British scientists set off on a six-week trip to study the hole in the crust.\nThe hole is about 4,800 meters below sea level and is believed to be more than 48,000 meters long and more than 48,000 meters wide. Scientists think that there are other nearby gaps. \"It is like a window into the interior   of the Earth,\" says scientist   Bramley Murton, who is part of the research team.\nThe site where the hole is located is part of a ridge   of undersea volcanoes.  There, two of the plates that make up the Earth's surface meet. The plates are always   moving. When the plates move away from each other, lava rushes up from the mantle to   fill the gap and form a new crust. But this did not happen in the area where the hole is located.\nThe hole is giving researchers a good opportunity to study what's below the Earth's   surface. The team will use a special robotic tool to film the area and get samples of the exposed mantle.

In 2010, several 3D movies bombed at the box office. And by late 2010, Some people said the technology was dead. Of course, this isn't the first time Hollywood has struggled with new technology. Although sound was added to movies in the late 1920s, it took audiences time to get used to the new technology. But in the end, sound and color became the standard. James Cameron, director of Avatar, thinks we're going through the same process with 3D.\nSome say cinemas are charging too much for 3D movies. In the US, seeing a 3D movie can cost up to $7.5 more than seeing it in 2D. Also, a recent study at California State University found audiences don't actually enjoy movies in 3D any more than in 2D. Walter Murch , a famous movie editor, wrote in 2011 that human beings have no ability to process 3D images. Watching a 3D movie confuses our brain and this is why some people get headaches.\nBut James Cameron disagrees. In fact, he recently predicted that in five years all movies will be in 3D. And there are signs that 3D is fighting back. More 3D movies were put on the market in 2012 than ever before. The Lion King 3D recently made over US $150 million at the box office, and Cameron's Titanic 3D made even more.\nWho knows what the future holds for 3D?

The article reported that the board of education had decided to use  _ tray in the lunchroom because they were less expensive than paper one's.\n    Vogt knew from her science class that polystyrene can have harmful effects on the environment in the first place.

Scientific evidence indicates that these CFCs break down the protective ozone layer of the atmosphere. \n    Vogt decided to write a paper for her social studies class on the issue of polystyrene. Her teacher, Carl Stehle,read her paper to the class. After reminding students that Thomas Paine had had to persuade many hesitant colonists  to support the American Revolution,Stehle challenged his class to do something about the polystyrene problem. \n    Vogt and her classmates immediately conducted a survey in the high school and middle school . They discovered that a large majority of students said they wanted to switch back to paper goods in the cafeteria. When they presented their findings to the board of education,the boards business administrator did a survey of his own. He found that roughly 80 percent of the students in the two schools would be willing to pay extra 5 cents to eat their lunch from paper trays.

Therefore, in my opinion, a good friend is one who can enjoy your successes without envy; one who can say, \"That was wonderful! You can do it again, even better if you want!\" and mean it.\n.

No wonder many minor friendships go down day by day for the same reason.\nA person of good character and sound moral, of honor and humor, of courage and belief is a friend to be sought and treasured -- for there are few. Too often we hear, \"If you can count your good friends on more than one hand, consider yourself blessed.\"\nWhat makes a friendship last? Well, I don't know all the answers, but one of my observations is that most good friends usually have similar tastes. They generally like and dislike many of the same things. There also usually seems to exist a similarity of personality types -- especially in the fundamental values of life such as honesty, sincerity, loyalty, and dependability.

The action follows recent reports about the storing of information on the Apple iPhone. Some people consider location tracking to be a threat to personal privacy and security.\nAllan Friedman, the research director, says, \"All wireless companies do some location tracking as part of their networks. This information is usually stored by the companies, not the devices, and there are laws to protect it. Law enforcement  agencies, for example, have to have a fairly high standard before it can access that data. And the phone company is also prohibited from selling that information.\nNow, two researchers report that location tracking information is being stored directly on Apple devices. They said Apple's newest operating systems gather global positioning system and timestamp information. The information is stored on the device in a file that is also uploaded   to any computer that the device is connected to. The researchers say the information is available to anyone who has access to the device or computer.\nAllan Friedman says, \"This raises additional concerns. There's the idea that because it's on my phone and on my computer, rogue applications  that I pay for or that I'm tricked into downloading may be able to access this data and somehow misuse it.\"\nApple says it is \"not tracking the location of your iPhone\". It is simply keeping a database of Wi-Fi hotspots and cell phone towers near the user's location. This information is meant to help the iPhone quickly find its location when needed.\nLetters have been sent to some of the leading mobile device developers, including Apple and Google. The letters asked for more information about their location tracking systems. Allan Friedman calls this an important start to strengthening privacy laws. He says, \"There aren't strong controls over things like location information, what they are doing with it, how long they are keeping it.

With a new library card,a child will feel extra grownup by borrowing books.\nRead on the road. Going on a long car trip?Make sure there are some books at the back seat. When you stop driving,read the books aloud. Get some audio books in libraries and listen to them together during driving time.\nMake your own books. Pick one of your family's favorite parts of summer--whether it's baseball,ice cream, or the pool--and have your child draw pictures of it or cut out pictures from magazines. Stick  the pictures onto paper to make a booklet and write text for it. When you're done,read the book together. Reread it whenever you like!\nKeep in touch. Kids don't have to go away to write about summer vacation. Even if your family stays home,they can send postcards to tell friends and relatives about their adventures . Ask a relative to be your child's pen pal and encourage them to write each week.\nKeep up the reading habits. Even if everything else changes during the summer,keep up the reading habits around your house. Read with your kids every day--whether it's just before bedtime or under a shady tree on a lazy afternoon.

Electric cars users may also eventually be able to charge their vehicles wirelessly using the same technology according to Fujitsu, which presented a system at an Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers Conference at Osaka Prefecture University.\nClaiming to be the world's first of its kind, the technology works on the basis of the transmission of electricity using magnetic fields between the charger and the electronic device. The system enables wireless charging at distances of up to several metres, with the final aim of installing public \"charging spots\" on the streets in order to enable easy charging around the clock.\nScientists at Fujitsu Laboratories are planning to commercially sell products including the new wireless charging system as early as 2012 but did not make it clear how much they would cost. \"This technology makes it possible to add compact wireless charging functions into mobile phones and enabling several portable devices to be charged at the same time without any restrictions on their position in association with the charger,\" the company said in a statement.\nThe growing popularity of portable electronic devices ranging from iPads to e-readers is expected to fuel a boom in wireless recharging technology developments over the coming decade. \nMobile phone users in Japan can currently fill up their batteries using disposable portable plug-in battery-operated devices -- available at most train stations and convenience stores -- although phone companies warn any use for too long can damage the phones.\nThe new system displayed by Fujitsu, however, is significantly advanced and represents the next generation of portable recharging systems using highly tuned wireless technology.

Whether you're going to Yunnan or UK, it's important to make sure you're well-prepared. Here's a handy checklist to help you.\nLocation\nThe first thing you have to decide is where you want to go. Of course a lot will depend on your time and budget. Do you want to relax on a beach, visit some famous landmarks, or hike through some beautiful scenery? All these things are available in China, but if your budget stretches, why not look at somewhere else in Asia, or even farther.\nPacking\nThere can be such a thing as being over prepared when traveling, but you don't want to forget something important. It can be a good idea to wear pants with zipped pockets. In certain countries local thieves will target unsuspecting tourists for their money. It can also be worth packing some basic medical supplies. If you are going to be moving around a lot, buy a good backpack. Finally, remember to pack clothes that are going to be suitable for the weather.\nAccommodation\nThere are several things to consider when picking where you want to stay. Location is often the most important. When staying in hotels, it is often a good idea to book your first night in a new city. After all, you will not be familiar with the surroundings and will want somewhere to leave your luggage. However, don't spend more than a couple of days at the same hotel. When you get to a new place, you might soon discover there's somewhere better to stay.\nDon't forget\nThe key to a good holiday is detail. When you're traveling, especially in a foreign country, don't forget to change some money before you leave. If you're traveling somewhere tropical, you might need some injections or pills to avoid disease. And it's always worth taking out travel insurance, just in case you find yourself in a spot of bother during the trip. Don't forget to check the exchange rates. The strong yuan has made traveling abroad cheaper recently.

Here is a checklist that covers some of the major links in the job-search chain.\nTHE RESUME --- Make sure it is up-to-date and tailored to the types of jobs you are seeking for. Have someone else look at your resume. If you cannot afford a career coach, give your resume to friends or family members to _ Have copies of your resume printed so that you are ready to hand them out at interviews.\nCOVERING LETTERS --- Maybe you've set up a few basic styles in advance, but that's not enough. Each covering letter should be designed to suit the job for which you are applying.\nTHE WARDROBE  --- Check your wardrobe to ensure that you have the appropriate professional dress, including shoes, ready for interview.\nNETWORKING --- Don't isolate yourself from others for days. Network through e-mail messages, phone calls, appointments and meetings keep you in touch with the outside world and prevent you from becoming depressed.\nAPPLICATION --- A glance at huge online job sites isn't usually the best way to find a job. You are more likely to succeed through the people you know via networking.\nTHE FOLLOW--UP --- It is quite common to apply for job and never hear back from the company. Take measures, such as following up with a phone call a week or so after you apply. If you know someone at the company, check whether that person will put in a good word for you.\nINTERVIEWS --- If you've got plenty of interviews but no return calls or job offers, take a look at your interviewing skills. This is one area where investing in a career coach may pay off. But if you can't afford one, try to find a job group or service that conducts free mock  interviews.\nSUPPORT SYSTEMS --- Finally, recognize that looking for job is rather difficult. Even at the best of times, a job hunt is often about rejection, and that can be hard to endure. Staying in touch with family, friends, professional networks and fellow job seekers can help you to maintain a positive attitude and a sense of perspective.", "id": "high4505.txt"}, {"answers": ["B", "A", "A", "C", "D"], "options": [["China", "America", "Japan", "France"], ["likes sitting on a couch watching TV", "does nothing all day", "likes eating potatoes", "only watches TV and eats potatoes"], ["almost never moves while watching TV and gets very fat", "is fat and dying and can not take exercise", "likes eating potatoes on a couch while watching TV", "is frozen in front of the black box"], ["how to watch TV", "why couch-potatoes are very fat", "what couch-potato means", "where you can find couch-potatoes"], ["Take exercise.", "Never watch TV.", "Don't sit on a couch.", "Don't watch TV too much."]], "questions": ["The word \"couch-potato\" is often used in   _  .", "If a person is called a couch-potato, he or she   _  .", "Why does a couch-potato look like a real potato?

It promotes home cooking, and the use of fresh, unprocessed produce. It was founded as reaction to the popularity of unhealthy fast food. It also encourages people to buy food from local businesses, rather than large supermarkets.\nThe movement began in 1986. at that time, McDonald's wanted to open a restaurant in the centre of Rome (Italy). Food writer Carlo Perini, along with others, was against this. So, the Slow Food Organization was born. Today, it has overt 100,00 members in 132 countries. And its symbol is one of the world's slowest moving creatures, the snail. The organization's website explains, \"The snail was chosen because it moves slowly, and calmly eats its way through life.\"\nBut Slow Food isn't just about the food we eat. It's also about how we eat it. Slow foodies say that in our fast - food world with very little time, we've forgotten that eating should be a social activity. They believe families should eat together and talk, rather than watch TV with their dinner while sitting in front of it. In fact, research has shown that if children grow up in a family that eats together at the table, they are more likely to do well in school, and less likely to have behavioral problems or devel op eating disorders.\nAnd there's more! Slow Food has sparked an entire Slow Food Movement. This encourages people to slow down the pace of their busy lives. And now, within the movement, there's Slow Money, Slow Travel, Slow Parenting, Slow Art and Slow Media, among many others. In 1999 The World Institute of Slowness was formed. One of the Institute's slogans is a quotation by the famous American actress Mae West. She said, \"Everything worth doing in life, is worth doing slowly.\" Do you agree?

On Aug. 4, Graham and Sheryl Anley, while boating off the coast of South Africa, hit a rock. As the boat threatened to sink, the husband got off, but his wife was trapped in the boat. Instead of freeing his wife and getting her to shore, Graham grabbed Rosie, their pet dog. With Rosie safe and sound, Graham returned for Sheryl. All are doing fine. \n It's a great story, but it doesn't strike me as especially newsworthy. News is supposed to be about something fairly unique, and recent research suggests that, in the right circumstances, lots of people also would have grabbed their Rosie first.  \nWe have strange relationships with our pets. We look after our pets with great love and better health care than billions of people receive. We speak to pets with the same high-pitched voices that we use for babies. As an extreme example of our feelings about pets, the Nazis had strict laws that guaranteed the kind treatment of the pets of Jews being shipped to death camps.  \nA recent paper by George Regents University demonstrates this human involvement with pets to an astonishing extent. Participants in the study were told a situation in which a bus is out of control, bearing down on a dog and a human. Which do you save? With responses from more than 500 people, the answer was that it depended: What kind of human and what kind of dog?\n Everyone would save a brother, grandparent or close friend rather than a strange dog. But when people considered their own dog VS people less connected with them--a distant cousin or a hometown stranger--votes in favor of saving the dog came rolling in. And an astonishing 40% of respondents, including 46% of women, voted to save their dog over a foreign tourist.  \n What does a finding like this mean? First, that your odds aren't so good if you find yourself in another country with a bus bearing down on you and a cute dog. But it also points to something deeper: our unprecedented  attitude toward animals, which got its start with the birth of kind-hearted societies in the 19th century.  \nWe prison people who abuse animals, put ourselves in harm's way in boats between whales and whalers and show sympathy to Bambi and his mother. We can extend sympathy to an animal and feel its pain like no other species. But let's not be too proud of ourselves.

As a result, facial expressions that had been considered universally recognizable cannot be used to reliably convey emotion in cross-cultural situations.\nThe researchers studied cultural differences in the recognition of facial expressions by recording the eye movements of 13 Western Whites and 13 East Asian people while they observed pictures of expressive faces and put them into categories: happy, sad, surprised, fearful, disgusted, angry, or neutral. They compared how accurately participants read those facial expressions using their particular eye movement strategies.\nIt turned out that Easterners focused much greater attention on the eyes and made significantly more errors than Westerners did. \"The cultural difference in eye movements that _ show is probably a reflection of cultural difference in facial expressions,\" Jack said. \"Our data suggest that whereas Westerners use the whole face to convey emotion, Easterners use the eyes more and mouth less.\"\nIn short, the data show that facial expressions are not universal signals of human emotion.

Acting as something absorbing heat, the oceans have absorbed huge amounts of heat and CO2 in the last forty years.\nFujita explains, \"the oceans are saving us from faster climate change--they are putting a brake on the climate system.\"\n\"That's the good news,\" he adds. \"The bad news is that the oceans only slow the atmospheric warming. Once the oceans come to balance with a greenhouse-gas warmed earth, the extreme heat will remain in the atmosphere and things will get much hotter.\" But where and how the oceans release this slowly increased heat is uncertain. And as the ocean stores heat, fragile  underwater ecosystems are struggling.\nThe most recent scientific report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC) also notes with concern that the ocean is acidifying  because of increased absorption of atmospheric CO2. and thus causing a threat to shell-forming species.  Sharp increase in CO2 levels will cause further acidification of the ocean.\nCurrents distributing heat\nAnother important role the oceans play is that of distributor . Oceans deliver heat and life-sustaining nutrition around the globe. Just as blood tube bring oxygen and nutrition to cells in the human body, the ocean's currents carry oxygen, nutrients and heat throughout the Earth. The ocean distributes 25 to 50 per cent of energy the planet receives from the sun. For example, the Gulf Stream carries heat across the Atlantic.

We are part of the problem.\"\nAmong the \"things that we do that make the things that we teach less learnable,\" Crow said, are the strict separation of disciplines, academic rigidity, and conservatism, the desire of universities to imitate schools at the top of the social ranks, and the lack of the computer system ability that would allow a large number of students to be educated for a small amount of money.\nSince 2002, when Crow started being in charge at Arizona State -- which he calls the \"new American university\" -- he has led more than three dozen initiatives that aim to make the school \"inclusive, scalable, fast, adaptive, challenge-focused, and willing to take risks.\"\nAmong those initiatives were a restructuring of the engineering and life sciences schools to create more linkages between disciplines; the launch of the School of Earth and Space Exploration and the School of Sustainability; the start of a Teachers College to address K-12 performance and increase the status of the Education Department at the university; and broadened access, increasing the freshman class size by 42 percent and the enrollment of students living below the poverty line by 500 percent.\nUniversities must start, Crow noted, \"by becoming self-reflective _ figuring out what we have and what we actually need instead of what legend tells us we have to be.\" Research universities today have \"run their course,\" he added. \"Now is the time for variety.\"\nDuring a discussion afterward, Crow clarified and expanded on some of his points. He discussed, for example, the school's distance-learning program. \"Nearly 40 percent of undergraduates are taking at least one course online,\" he said, which helps the school to keep costs down while advancing interactive learning technologies.\nHe said that Arizona State is working to increase the transfer and completion rates of community-college students, of whom only about 15 percent, historically, complete their later degrees. \"We've built a system that will allow them to track into universities,\" particularly where \"culturally complex barriers\" beyond finances limit even the most gifted students.", "id": "high13043.txt"}, {"answers": ["B", "C", "B"], "options": [["likes to buy goods online", "likes the games sites", "likes to pay for entertainment", "likes to send e-mails"], ["goods bought online are of low quality", "people can't have a look at the goods", "it is more difficult for sales returns", "people haven't computers"], ["young", "female", "well educated", "richer"]], "questions": ["A typical Chinese Internet user will be the one who   _  .", "Online purchases still remain unpopular in China mainly because   _  .", "Which of the following words fails to describe the typical netizens in the five cities?"], "article": "Survey Studies Internet Use in China\nA typical  Chinese Internet user is a young male who prefers instant messaging to e-mail, seldom makes online purchases  and favors news, music and games sites.

Near the surface earthquakes may run as high as 100 in a month, but the yearly average does not vary much. In comparison with the total number of earthquakes each year, the number of disastrous earthquakes is very small.[JP]\nThe extent of the disaster in an earthquake depends on many factors. If you carefully build a toy house with an erect set, it will still stand no matter how much you shake the table. But if you build a toy house with a pack of cards, a slight shake of the table will make it fall. An earthquake in prefix = st1 /Agadir,Morocco, was not strong enough to be recorded on distant instruments, but it completely destroyed the city. Many stronger earthquakes have done comparatively little damage. If a building is well constructed and built on solid ground, it will resist an earthquake. Most deaths in earthquakes have been due to faulty building construction or poor building sites. A third and very serious factor is panic. When people rush out into narrow streets, more deaths will result.\nThe United Nations has played an important part in reducing the damage done by earthquakes. It has sent a team of experts to all countries known to be affected by earthquakes. Working with local geologists and engineers, the experts have studied the nature of the ground and the type of most practical building code for the local area. If followed, these suggestions will make disastrous earthquakes almost a thing of the past.\nThere is one type of earthquake disaster that little can be done about. This is the disaster caused by seismic sea waves, or tsunamis. (These are often called tidal waves, but the name is incorrect. They have nothing to do with tides.) \nIn certain areas, earthquakes take place beneath the sea. These submarine earthquakes sometimes give rise to seismic sea waves. The waves are not noticeable out at sea because of their long wave length. But when they roll into harbors, they pile up into walls of water 6 to 60 feet high. The Japanese call them \"tsunamis\", meaning \"harbor waves\", because they reach a sizable height only in harbors.\nTsunamis travel fairly slowly, at speeds up to 500 miles an hour. An adequate warning system is in use to warn all shores likely to be reached by the waves.\nBut this only enables people to leave the threatened shores for higher ground.

The economic costs of tobacco use are equally devastating  . In addition to the high public health costs of treating tobacco-caused diseases, tobacco kills people at the height of their productivity, depriving   families of breadwinners and nations of a healthy workforce.

Many unfortunate women were taken away on this sort of evidence and hanged.\nWitch fever held East Anglia for 14 terrible months between 1645--1646.

He had 68 people put to death in Bury St. Edmunds alone, and 19 hanged at Chelmsfor in a single day. After Chelmsford he set off for other countries. Much of Matthew Hopkins theories of telling a witch were based on Devil's Marks. He took a small mark to be a Devil's Mark and he used his \"needle\" to see if these marks were insensitive to pain. His \"needle\" was basically a trick so the unfortunate women never felt any pain.\nThere were other tests for witches. Mary Sutton of Bedford was put to the swimming test.

Plant communication is not idea, and cannot indicate that it is a kind of intelligence, but it is still interesting.\nRecent research from Vidi researcher Josef Stuefer at the Radboud University Nijmegen shows that plants have their own chat systems that they can use to warn each other. Therefore plants are not boring and passive organisms that just stand there waiting to be cut down or eaten up. Many plants form internal communication networks and are able to exchange information networks and are able to exchange information efficiently.\nMany herbal plants such as strawberries and clovers  naturally form networks. Individual plants remain connected with each other for a certain period of time by means of runners (plant stems that grow along the ground and put down roots to form new plants). These connections enable the plants to share information with each other via internal channels. They are therefore very similar to computer networks. But what do plants chat to each other about?\nRecently Stuefer and hus colleagues were the first to prove that clover plants warn each other via the network links if danger is nearby. If one of the plants is attacked by caterpillars  , the other members of the network are warned via an internal signal. Once warned the intact  plants strengthen their chemical and mechanicaicl resistance so that they are less attractive to advancing  caterpillars. Thanks to this early warning system, the plants can stay one step ahead of their attackers. The research has shown that this significantly limits the damage to the plants.\nAgain, I don't believe this reflects intelligence,", "id": "high23335.txt"}, {"answers": ["C", "B", "D", "D", "A"], "options": [["Famous stars in Bollywood.", "How Hollywood movies are made.", "The difference between two movie industries.", "The history of movie-making in India."], ["It is the movie capital of India.", "The new name is Bombay.", "More movies are made there than in Hollywood.", "It is less expensive to make films there than in Hollywood."], ["They are very popular.", "They show Indian culture.", "They are much longer than Hollywood films.", "They mix different styles of movies."], ["they are shorter than Hollywood films", "the scripts are written by hand", "the movies do not use any special effects", "one movie can reuse things from other movies"], ["Most Bollywood movies are very similar.", "It takes a lot of money to make a good movie.", "Only Indian people can understand Bollywood movies.", "Hollywood movies are too short."]], "questions": ["What is the main topic of the reading?", "What is NOT true about Mumbai?", "Why are Bollywood films often called \"masala\" films?", "Bollywood films are cheap to make because  _  .", "Which of the statements would the writer probably agree with?"], "article": "Most people think that the capital of the movie world is Hollywood in the United States. However, the real movie capital is Mumbai, in India. Mumbai used to be known as Bombay, and so the film industry there is called \"Bollywood.\" Bollywood makes twice as many movies each year as Hollywood--more than 800 films a year.\nThe movies from Bollywood are very different from Hollywood movies. For one thing, Bollywood movies are much longer than most Hollywood movies. Most Bollywood movies are more than three hours long, and contain singing, dancing, action, adventure, mystery and romance (but usually no kissing). Because Bollywood films contain so many different features, this style of film is sometimes called a \"masala\" film. (\"Masala\" is an Indian word for a mixture of species.)\nAnother big difference between Bollywood and Hollywood movies is the way movies are made. It takes much longer to make a movie in Hollywood than in Bollywood. In fact, filming may begin on a Bollywood movie before the script is finished. The director and writer can make up the story while the film is being made. Sometimes they will even write the script   by hand instead of taking time to type it.\nBollywood actors are very popular and some are in such high demand that they may work on several movies at the same time. They may even shoot  scenes for several films on the same day using the same costumes and scenery. Since most Bollywood movies follow the same kind of story, shooting scenes for several films at the same time is not a big problem for actors or directors.

Up until the 20th century, the majority of Americans lived in the countryside, in what's called --Middle America or the Heartland.\nBut research has shown that growing up in America's Heartland can put students at a disadvantage when it comes to their college education. This, in turn, can hinder (to make it difficult for something to develop or succeed) their social mobility.\nA 2015 study released by the US Department of Education investigated the gap between urban and rural college students, by concentrating on a group of high school graduates from Indiana.\nUS' national statistics had previously shown that only 27 percent of rural students enroll in college, compared to 37 percent of city kids.\nWhat the study found was that urban and rural students left high school with similar academic backgrounds. Yet, the rural students were more inclined to settle for two-year colleges or less selective universities, even though they had the potential to attend to better schools.\nThe researchers say distance heavily influenced the students' decisions. The farther rural graduates high schools were from colleges, the more likely rural graduates were to enroll in a two-year college or to undermatch with a college, the report read. Many of the rural students indicated that living close to family was a priority.\nBut the researchers also noted that resources were scarcer for the rural students. Selective universities tended to concentrate their recruitment efforts on dense, urban centers, where there were more students to meet.\nA rural teen's educational opportunities may also depend on gender. Casey Quinlan, writing for The Atlantic, notes that rural women are more likely to marry sooner. Early marriage occurs most frequently among young adults with low educational background, Quinlan said, citing a 2010 study.\nBut the problem of social mobility isn't limited to the rural population. The United States has one of the highest rates of income inequality among developed nations. And by some measures, rural residents might have an advantage.\nStanford University's 2015 Poverty and Inequality Report found that poverty was hardest to escape in the American South, and in places with high racial segregation. It concluded that urban areas actually--tend to have lower rates of social mobility than rural areas.\nThe successful children growing up in rural areas do not just ' _ ' but also generally move out. That is, they typically move to large metropolitan areas, often out of their state of birth, the report explained.\nRural areas are also hoping to give their residents a boost up the social ladder.

If we eat a good breakfast, they say, we will have the energy and nutrients   we need to begin our working day with vigor  and stay hopeful with good honor. However, many people skip breakfast or _ . What happens if we ignore the importance of breakfast?\nOne recent study conducted in the United States tested a large number of people. Participants included both males and females who ranged in age from 12 to 83. The results showed that if a person eats an adequate breakfast, he or she will work more efficiently and more productively than if he or she skips breakfast or eats a very poor breakfast. This fact appears to be especially true if a person's work involves mental  activities. The study showed that if school-children eat fruit, eggs, bread and milk before going to school, they will learn more quickly and will be able to concentrate  on their lessons for a longer period of time than if their breakfast is inadequate.\nThe study also showed that contrary to what people believe, if you skip breakfast, you will not lose weight. This is because people become so hungry if they skip breakfast that they eat too much for lunch and end up gaining weight instead of losing. So remember, if you want to lose weight, skipping breakfast will not help you.

Indeed, some writers have identified thinking with using words: Plato coined the saying, \"In thinking the soul is talking to itself\"; J. B. Watson reduced thinking to inhibited  speech located in the minute  movements or tensions of the physiological mechanisms involved in speaking; and although Ryle is careful to point out that there are many senses in which a person is said to think and in which words are not in evidence, he has also said that saying something in a specific frame of mind is thinking a thought.\nIs thinking reducible to, or dependent upon, language habits? It would seem that many thinking situations are hardly distinguishable from the skillful use of language, although there are some others in which language is not involved. Thought cannot be simply identified with using language. It may be the case, of course, that the non-linguistic skills involved in thought can only be acquired and developed if the learner is able to use and understand language. However, this question is one which we cannot hope to answer in this book. Obviously being able to use language makes for a considerable development in all one's capacities but how precisely this comes about we cannot say.\nAt the common-sense level it appears that there is often a distinction between thought and the words we employ to communicate with other people. We often have to struggle hard to find words to capture what our thinking has already grasped, and when we do find words we sometimes feel that they fail to do their job properly. Again when we report or describe our thinking to other people we do not merely report unspoken words and sentences. Such sentences do not always occur in thinking, and when they do they are merged with vague imagery and the hint of unconscious or subliminal  activities going on just out of rage. Thinking, as it happens, is more like struggling, striving, or searching for something than it is like talking or reading.\nAgain the study of speech disorders due to brain injury disease suggests that patients can think without having adequate control over their language. Some patients, for example, fail to find the names of objects presented to them and are unable to describe simple events which they witness; they even find it difficult to interpret long written notices. But they succeed in playing games of chess or draughts. They can use the concepts needed for chess playing or draught playing but are unable to use many of the concepts in ordinary language. How they manage to do this we do not know.

The \"clumsy\" seagulls   are far less agile   and have to struggle to get away from the wave. But these \"clumsy\" birds prove to have the biggest, strongest wings, which open the widest and allow the bird to travel the furthest. When the season changes, they leave for foreign shores, leaving the little birds behind.

Studies show that chances of dying after a car accident are twenty-five times greater in cases where people are \"thrown clear\".\nMyth Number Two: Safety belts \"trap\" people in cars that are burning or sinking in water.\nTruth: Sorry again, but studies show that people knocked unconscious  due to not wearing safety belts have a greater chance of dying in these accidents. People wearing safety belts are usually protected to the point of having a clear head to free themselves from such dangerous situations, not to be trapped in them.\nMyth Number Three: Safety belts aren't needed at speeds of less than 30 miles per hour.\nTruth: When two cars traveling at 30 mph hit each other, an unbelted driver would meet the windshield with a force equal to diving headfirst into the ground from a height of 10 meters.", "id": "high5198.txt"}, {"answers": ["C", "B", "D", "B"], "options": [["a heart attack", "a backache", "a knee problem", "a bone cancer"], ["career", "attitude", "health", "family"], ["lonely but ambitious", "miserable but easy-going", "hopeless but humorous", "unlucky but positive"], ["Escape the Fate", "Love Your Life", "Make a Living", "Remember Every Moment"]], "questions": ["From the passage we can learn that the author once suffered from   _   .", "The author finally realizes that the joy in your life is determined by your   _   .", "The author can be best described as   _   .", "Which of the following can be the best title for the passage ?"], "article": "Occasionally , life can be impossibly difficult , and it can be hard to keep going .

Man, even five hundred years ago, was shorter than he is today. Now, on average, men are about three inches taller. Five hundred years is a  ly short period of time, so we may assume that man will continue to grow taller. Again, in the modem world we use our brains a great deal. Even so, we still make use of only about 20% of the brain's capacity. As time goes on, however, we shall have to use our brains more and more, and eventually we shall need larger ones! This is likely to bring about a physical change too: the head, in particular the forehead, will grow larger.\nNowadays our eyes are in constant use.  In fact, we use them so much that very often they become weaker and we have to wear glasses. But over a very long period of time it is likely that man's eyes will grow stronger.\nOn the other hand, we tend to make less use of our arms and legs. These, as a result, are likely to grow weaker. At the same time, however, our fingers will grow more sensitive because they are used a great deal in modem life.\nBut what about hair? This will probably disappear from the body altogether in course of time because it does not serve a useful purpose any longer.

Not that the desire to kill had suddenly come to her, or that she felt she would leave India safer with one wild beast less. It was because Loona Bimberton had recently taken a plane to the forest and killed a tiger, and the newspapers showed photographs of Loona Bimberton with a tiger-skin on. In a world supposed to be moved by hunger and by love, Mrs. Packletide's movements were largely governed by dislike of Loona Bimberton.\nCircumstances proved favorable. Mrs. Packletide had offered a thousand rupees   for the opportunity of shooting a tiger without risk or effort, and it happened that an old tiger was frequently coming to a neighboring village at night. He was so old that he couldn't kill animals in the wild and just satisfied his appetite to the smaller household animals. The villagers were eager to earn the thousand rupees; children were posted night and day in the jungle to watch the tiger, and the cheap goats were left about to keep him from going elsewhere. The one great fear was that he should die of old age before the day of Mrs. Packletide's shoot.\nThe great night arrived. A platform had been built in a tree, on which sat Mrs. Packletide and her paid companion, Miss Mebbin. A goat with a loud bleat   was tied down at the correct distance. With an accurate gun, they waited for the coming of the tiger.\n\"I suppose we are in some danger?\" said Miss Mebbin.\nShe was not actually nervous about the wild beast, but she was unwilling to perform a bit more service than she had been paid for.\n\"It's a very old tiger. It couldn't spring up here even if it wanted to.\" said Mrs. Packletide.\nTheir conversation was cut short by the appearance of the old tiger. He saw the goat, and lay on the earth for a short rest before attacking.\nThe gun fired very loudly, and the great yellow beast jumped to one side and then rolled over in the stillness of death. In a moment a crowd of excited villagers appeared on the scene, and their shouting carried the glad news to the village.\nIt was Miss Mebbin who found that the goat was dying from a bullet-wound, while no wound could be found on the tiger. Evidently the wrong animal had been hit, and the tiger had died of heart-failure, caused by the sudden loud noise of the gun. Mrs. Packletide was annoyed at the discovery; but anyway, she owned a dead tiger, and the villagers, anxious for their thousand rupees, gladly accepted the fiction that she had shot the tiger. And Miss Mebbin was a paid companion. Therefore Mrs. Packletide faced the cameras with a light heart, and her pictures appeared on the newspapers of England and America. As for Loona Bimberton, she refused to look at a newspaper for weeks, and was in a depressed emotion for quite some time.\nMrs. Packletide's tiger-skin was inspected and admired by the neighbors, and Mrs. Packletide went to the Costume Ball in the character of Diana  .\n\"How amused everyone would be if they knew what really happened,\" said Miss Mebbin a few days after the ball.\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Mrs. Packletide quickly.\n\"How you shot the goat and frightened the tiger to death,\" said Miss Mebbin, with her unpleasant laugh.\n\"No one would believe it,\" said Mrs. Packletide, her face changing color1 rapidly.\n\"Loona Bimberton would,\" said Miss Mebbin.\nMrs. Packletide's face settled on greenish white. \"You surely wouldn't give me away?\" she asked.\n\"I've seen a weekend cottage near Dorking,\" said Miss Mebbin, \"six hundred and eighty.

I then spent the next four years learning how to learn and find strategies that allowed me to return to my district's high school with the ability to communicate my ideas and express my intelligence.          \nNow, I can easily solve the 5x5x5. I discover that just before it is solved, a problem can look like a mess, and then suddenly you can find the solution. Early in my Rubik's career, I became so frustrated that I took the cube apart and rebuilt it. I believe that sometimes you have to look deeper and find answers in unexpected places. The Rubik's cube taught me that to accomplish something big, it helps to break it down into small pieces. I learned that it's important to spend a lot of time thinking, to try to find connections and patterns. I believe that there are surprises around the corner.\nLike life itself, the Rubik's cube can be frustrating puzzle. So everyday I carry a Rubik's cube in my backpack as a reminder that I can achieve my goals, no matter what obstacles I face.", "id": "high17860.txt"}, {"answers": ["B", "D", "A", "B"], "options": [["sing and play music like a CD player.", "help children say and learn phrases", "store words and phrases for future use.", "help children learn basic knowledge of computer"], ["It is an electric timer which is used for sports events.", "It is a kind of clock which can wake you up in the morning.", "It is machine which can teach you English phrases.", "It is a toy with which you can play phrase competitions with others."], ["there are two ways to contact the company.", "the new version will announce the scores", "the toy is too difficult for kids to play with.", "the company is the biggest toy company in the world."], ["In a science fiction", "In a newspaper", "In a medical magazin", "In a guidebook"]], "questions": ["Hasbro Electronic Catch Phrase can be used to   _  .", "What do you know about Hasbro Electronic Catch Phrase ?", "It can be known from the passage that   _  .", "Where can you probably read the article ?"], "article": "Name: Hasbro Electronic Catch Phrase\nPrice: $25\nProduct Features:\n-- Classic electronic Catch Phrase with over a thousand updated new phrases for 2013.\n --When the buzzer  begins, you have to guess fast and then pass the game fast, so you won't get caught holding it when the buzzer stops!

In 1998, they were proven completely wrong. Though it flies in the face of scientific theory, the universe is expanding at an ever-increasing rate. \nOne possible explanation is that empty space has a thing called dark energy, which supposedly makes up about three quarters of the universe. Dark energy supposedly very sparsely  exists in such a way that it interacts with other objects only through attracting force. It has a strong negative pressure, which causes it to pull on its surroundings and as a result, pull apart the universe. This neatly explains the universe's expansion without completely changing our understanding of the universe. Scientists can merely claim that dark energy \"should\" exist. \nAccording to Einstein's theory of relativity, it is impossible to travel faster than at the speed of light. \nWith this in mind, physicists set out to do the impossible and succeeded. In 2000, scientists in Princeton, New Jersey sent a small pulse  of laser light through a vapor made up of gaseous cesium . The pulse traveled so quickly that it was already leaving the vapor-filled chamber as it was still entering, roughly 300 times faster than it would have in a vacuum . Thus, light moved faster than the speed of light. \nOther experiments have since managed to conquer light's supposed speed limit, though all claims have had fine print that keeps them from being especially groundbreaking . Those seeking to truly prove Einstein wrong must instead turn to objects like black holes, which could theoretically cause things to move at faster-than-light speeds.

include some preemptive methods that can help reduce the risks of fires and control their severity and spread,and thus, maintain ecological balance and protect resources.Close monitoring of forest fires caused by natural factors can help prevent their spread to a large extent.To contain forest fires,fire departments usually use water and chemical fire retardants that can be dropped from planes and helicopters.To control the spread of a wildfire.firefighters usually create a control line by removing all fuel from an area so that the fire cannot travel across it.\nControlled burns are often employed by government authorities to reduce fuel buildup,and clean up the fallen leaves,and thus,prevent the spread of forest fires to a vast area.Regular controlled burns can also help maintain biodiversity ,as the smoke and heat produced in the process can facilitate the growth of seeds of certain plant species.Apart from these,responsible human behavior can help reduce the number of forest fires to a great extent.In fact,we can reduce the number of wildfires dramatically by not leaving behind any source of fire in the forest.\nForest fires can affect climate and weather to a great extent,besides causing severe damage to valuable trees.Wildfires can increase the level of greenhouse gases(water vapor, carbon dioxide,etc),and therefore increase pollution and global warming.However, they are also an important part of the ecosystem,and many plants depend on the heat and smoke generated by wildfires for their growth and reproduction.But large wildfires can cause

In effect, we will prevent them from growing up.\"\nThe comments echo  remarks made by teachers in recent years who claim the education system has been too focused on developing children's social skills at the expense of academic learning.

Named last month as one of the government's flagship academies, its students regularly come at or near the top of exam results for the entire country, outperforming such famous names as Eton or Harrow. But unlike those private schools, where fees can exceed PS28, 000 or PS45, 000 a year, Hockerill, in the Hertfordshire town, is a state comprehensive, which charges no tuition fees and is forbidden from selecting its students on the basis of academic ability. And while a third of Hockerill's 830 students are boarders, they are chosen on the basis of need rather than ability to pay.\nSo when the school's principal heard of government plans to raise university tuition fees in England to PS9, 000 a year, he decided to make use of the school's international focus. urging his students to apply to universities abroad and hiring a counselor  to help the students who want to apply to universities in countries whose fees are cheaper. \"If you can get into a university in France and pay about PS180 a year for an education at one of the best institutions in the world, why would you pay PS9, 000 a year in Britain?\" the principal asked.\nPupils at Hockerill are offered a choice of seven foreign languages: French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Japanese or Mandarin. History and geography classes are taught exclusively in French or German. But with English rapidly becoming the international language of education, even less linguistically flexible students soon find that going abroad can save them money while enhancing the quality of their education.\n\"Our students can get to Maastricht in Holland by train more quickly than they can get to Lees from London,\" the principal said.

However, there always have been some smart thieves in history. Now, almost all of Egypt's pyramids have been robbed, including the Great Pyramid of Khufu, which is the largest pyramid in the world. It is the only one of the ancient wonders of the world that is still standing.\nIn AD 820, an Arab king named Abdullah AL Manum got a group of workers to dig their way into the Great Pyramid and have a look. Inside the pyramid, they found three rooms --- the Queen's Chamber, the Grand Gallery and the King's Chamber. But to their surprise, the men didn't find the treasures they wanted. The Queen's and King's Chambers were both empty! Where were the King's mummy and his treasures? Had someone already taken them away? The huge stone doors at the pyramid's entrance were still closed when AL Manum's men went inside. How had the thieves got in and out?\nSince then, many people have gone inside the Great Pyramid to have a look or to try to take things.

For 2013,the winners are Barbados, Cape Verde, Costa Rica, Ghana, Latvia ,Lithuania, Mauritius, Palau, Samoa and Uruguay.\nThose 10 countries scored highest in three main areas: social welfare, environmental protection and human rights.\nGreenwald explained that countries must have a good tourism infrastructure to make the list, but the non-profit Ethical Traveler also uses the list to promote some under-visited places that can be a role model for other countries in their region. For example, Latvia earned high marks for improving its environmental efforts and strong human rights record, and the country's parks and nature reserves make for a great off-the-beaten-path ecotourism trip.\nIn addition to just visiting these countries, travelers should aim to spend their money in locally-owned business, Greenwald said, to ensure their financial support stays in the country they're visiting. However, that requires a well-maneged tourism infrastructure. While one could argue those poor places need the money even more, tourism can put pressure on countries that face such challenges.\nErica Avrami, research and education director at the World Monuments Fund(WMF) said that a list of ethical destinations is \"a wonderful idea\", the idea of being ethical goes both ways. \"There's also a certain responsibility on the part of the traveler to make sure their own footprint is as minimal as possible,\" she said.", "id": "high5653.txt"}, {"answers": ["B"], "options": [["there were stains on her blouse", "her blouse was wrinkled", "she wore heavy makeup", "she put on a wrong blouse"]], "questions": ["Jenelle found in the mirror that   _  ."], "article": "Janelle was running late for work, so she just had time for a quick look at herself in the mirror as she was going out.

He had recently lectured the entire staff on the importance of appearance, and had specifically mentioned the need for servers to wear clean, unwrinkled blouses. As an assistant manager, Janelle felt it was important to set an example for the other employees. But if she stopped to iron the blouse normally, she would be late --and work without delay was an area of even greater concern to her boss.\nSo she grabbed her iron and plugged it in and set it for low heat. Carefully holding her blouse away from her body, she continued to iron it while she was wearing it.

The theories of modem psychology have stepped in to argue that we must understand the need of children. Children are not just small adults; they are children who must be respected as much.\nWell, you may say, this is as it should be, a good idea. But think further. What happens? \"Education\" becomes the responsibility not of teachers, but of psychologists  . What happens then? Teachers worry too much about the psychological implications   of their lessons, and forget about the subjects themselves. If a child dislikes a lesson, the teacher feels that it is his fault, not the child's. So teachers worry whether history is \"relevant\" to modern young children. And do they dare to recount stories about violence? Or will this make the children themselves violent? Can they tell their classes about children of different races, or will this encourage racial hatred? Why teach children to write grammatical sentences? Verbal expression is better. Sums? Arithmetic? No: Real-life mathematical situations are more understandable.\nYou see, you can go too far. Influenced by educational theorists, who have nothing better to do than to write books about their ideas, teachers leave their teacher-training colleges filled with grand, psychological ideas about children and their needs. They make elaborate, sophisticated (,) preparations and try out their \"modem methods\" on the long-suffering children. Since one \"modem method\" rapidly replaces another the poor kids will have had a good bellyful by the time they leave school.

Turn your back for a moment and you find that every electronic item in your possession is as old as a tombstone. Why should you care if people laugh just because you use an old mobile phone?

You will be made to feel like some sort of time-traveler from the 1970s. \"Why not buy a new one?\" you will get asked.\nAnd so the mountain of electrical rubbish grows. An average British person was believed to get rid of quite a number of electronic goods in a lifetime. They weighed three tons, stood 7 feet high, and included five fridges, six microwaves, seven PCs, six TVs, 12 kettles, 35 mobile phones and so on. Even then, the calculation seemed to be conservative. Only 35 mobiles in a lifetime? The huge number of electronic items now regularly thrown away by British families is clearly one big problem. But this has other consequences. It contributes greatly to the uneasy feeling that modem technology is going by faster than we can keep up. By the time I've learnt how to use a tool it's already broken or lost. I've lost count of the number of TV remote-controls that I've bought, mislaid and replaced without working out what most of the buttons did.\nAnd the technology changes so unbelievably fast. It was less than years ago that I spotted an energetic businessman friend pulling what seemed to be either a large container or a small nuclear bomb on wheels through a railway station. I asked. \"What have you got in there? Your money or your wife?\" \"Neither,\" he replied, with the satisfied look of a man who knew he was keeping pace with the latest technology, no matter how ridiculous he looked. \"This is what everyone will have soon--even you. It's called a mobile telephone.\"\nI don't feel sorry for the pace of change. On the contrary, I'm amazed by those high-tech designers who can somehow fit a camera, music-player, computer and phone into a plastic box no bigger than a packet of cigarette. If those geniuses could also find a way to keep the underground trains running on the first snowy day of winter, they would be making real progress for human beings. What I do regret, however, is that so many household items fall behind so soon. My parents bought a wooden wireless radio in 1947, the year they were married. In 1973, the year I went to university, it was still working. It sat in the kitchen like an old friend--which, in a way, it was. It certainly spoke to us more than we spoke to each other on some mornings. When my mum replaced it with a new-style radio that could also play cassette-tapes, I felt a real sense of loss.\nSuch is the over-excited change of 21st-century technology that there's no time to satisfy our emotional needs.

We started a one-mile jog around the track. Repeatedly he fell, each time picking himself up. The same thing happened for weeks. But Michael put his whole heart into the training.

He built a square kite to which he attached an iron wire. He flew the kite with a hemp string , and near the base of the string he tied a large brass key. The kite rose into a dark thundercloud, where the iron wire picked up electrical charges. Franklin noticed that the strands of the string  were beginning to stand up with electricity. As rain wet the string, it conducted more electricity. Standing in the shelter of a shed, Franklin cautiously reached out his finger to touch the brass key.

Popcorn is a type of sweet corn that was originally grown in Mexico and spread to China, India and elsewhere. It is the only kind of corn that will pop. Today, most of the world's popcorn is grown in the United States.\nEvery popcorn kernel contains a tiny drop of water,surrounded by soft starch  .  When the popcorn is heated, the water turns into steam. This puts pressure on the surrounding hard kernel, forcing it to explode. The soft starch increases about 40 times in size as the corn kernel turns itself inside out.\nIn the 1500s popcorn was an important food source for the Aztec Indians of central and southern Mexico.  But it wasn't only food. It was also used in ceremonies or on red dresses and in necklaces. By the time the Europeans arrived in America,popcorn had spread through most of the American Indians.\nSome early American settlers ate popcorn with cream and sugar for breakfast. But it wasn't until the late 1800s that popcorn became popular. The demand for popcorn increased and farmers began farming popcorn. The first mobile popping machine was invented in 1885, and popcorn was sold by street sellers much like hot dogs that are sold today.\nDuring the Great Depression of the 1930s, the popcorn business still _ as people could still afford it. Then in the 1950s television arrived and popcorn consumption decreased. People stayed home and stopped going to the theatre. But the link between movies and popcorn had already existed.

The strangest attraction was the missing-in-action jaguar  . We spent several minutes searching for the animal without any luck. In most cases the zoo was good about putting up a sign if the animal was no longer there or was moved to a different location, but it was a different case with the jaguar and likewise the kangaroo.\nAlmost all of the hands-on equipment in the elephant encounter was broken and no longer working. Although the zoo did put up signs as an apology, it continued to add to the feeling that the zoo is approaching death. The one exhibit that did not fail to impress was the African Penguins. Their habitat was well built. The lion, bear, and tiger were also easy to watch. A favorite among the kids was clearly the monkeys who were very active and eager to put on a show.\nThe Tropical Rainforest did a very good job creating a special atmosphere.

When you've cut your list down to a manageable number, make arrangements to visit. Try to do this when the schools are having regular classes, so you can get a good idea of what life is really like on campus.\nAnd remember: you're not the only one making a decision.

Yet most people who eat fast food know it's bad for them. So why do they keep eating it?\nThe answer is simple: the benefits of eating fast food outweigh the long-term implications for most people. However, once you read these reasons why all those trips to the drive through may be slowly killing you, you may just want to stop eating fast food after all.\n1. Fast food makes you fat.\nA 15-year study of over 3,000 people found that eating fast food is linked to weight gain and insulin resistance. In others words, fast food makes you fat and increases your risk of type 2 diabetes. You probably know this already. But here's something you may not know.\n2. Fast food is addictive.\nThe more you eat fast food, the more you crave it. One study found that fast food is \"a potentially addictive substance that is most likely to create dependence in vulnerable populations.\" If you eat fast food once a week or more, you may be addicted to it.\n3. Fast food is affecting your kids.\nAccording to the CDC, childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and tripled in adolescents in the past 30 years. Kids have an amazing ability to recall ads they've seen. Fast food marketers know this, and design ads accordingly. Research shows strong associations between increases in advertising for non-nutritious foods and rates of childhood obesity.\n4. Fast food \"burgers\" don't have much burger in them.\nOne study found that most fast food burgers are composed of about 50 percent water and the actual meat content is only 2.1 to 14.8 percent. So what makes up the rest of it, you ask? Chemical fillers and preservatives, mostly. That's why we see read horror stories about burgers that don't go bad.\n5. Even \"healthy\" fast food isn't that healthy.\nFast food restaurants are catering to consumer demands to produce healthier options. The problem is, their definition of \"healthy\" is quite lax. One of the healthiest dishes at Burger King, the Garden Fresh Salad Chicken Caesar with TENDERGRILL Chicken and dressing, still has almost 500 calories and 28 grams of fat, and nearly a day's worth of sodium.\n6. Fast food is inhumane to animals.\nOkay, this one may not be a reason why fast is killing you, but it's still a compelling reason to stop eating fast food. 9 billion animals were slaughtered in the US alone in 2012 and much of that meat is for your fast food burgers and chicken sandwiches. Large factory farms resemble more of a \"business\" than a \"farm.\" Animals suffer in crowded spaces where they rarely have access to the outdoors or sunlight. They are pumped full of antibiotics to combat disease, which runs rampant in these conditions. Livestock is one of the biggest sources of pollution and environmental negligence, according to the UN.\n7. Fast food sodas are loaded with sugar.\nHigh fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is the cheap sweetener most fast food restaurants use in their sodas, desserts, and many other products. Princeton University researchers linked HFCS consumption to obesity in an animal study. Rats given HFCS gained more weight and body fat than those given table sugar.", "id": "high6397.txt"}, {"answers": ["B", "C", "A", "D"], "options": [["York Minster", "National Railway Museum", "York Castle Museum", "Clifford's Tower"], ["York Minster", "National Railway Museum", "York Castle Museum", "Clifford's Tower"], ["enjoy a treasure house of 800 years of stained glass", "go inside the shops and meet the folk working there", "have sweeping views of York and countryside", "see the world's fastest train and the Japanese Bullet Train"], ["phone 01904 557216", "email to castle.museum@ymt.org.uk", "visit the website www.nrm.org.uk", "write a letter to Tower Street, York YO1 9SA"]], "questions": ["Which of the following attractions is on Leeman Road?", "Where can visitors step into the well-known Victorian Street?", "While visiting York Minster, the visitors can   _  .", "If you want to know more information about Clifford's Tower, you can   _  ."], "article": "Attractions in York\nYork Minster\nDeangate, York YO17HH\nEnjoy the peaceful atmosphere of the largest Medieval Gothic cathedral in Northern Europe, a place for worship for over 1,000 years and a treasure house of 800 years of stained glass.

They write their own poems, say something about their girlfriends or boyfriends and complain to each other or offer support. But mostly they just write down what they do every day.\nHowever, many parents are afraid of these young bloggers. Parents see the kids talking about how they got drunk last weekend and how they don't like studying. They are using language that is surprising to their parents. Besides hearing from their friends, teen bloggers also get message from strangers. Most of the time, it's older men asking to meet teenage girls. \"These strange men are dangerous for my kids. They sometimes teach my kids bad words, \" said Cara Cabral, a mother of two.\nMany teens and young adults know it's not safe to use blogs on the Internet. They know they are putting information about themselves in a place they can be seen by anyone.

First, friends, relatives and co-workers may let us know that they value us. Our self-respect is strengthened when we feel accepted by others in spite of our faults and difficulties. Second, other people often provide us with informational support. They help us to define and understand our problems and find solutions to them. Third, we typically find social companionship supportive. Taking part in free-time activities with others helps us to meet our social needs while at the same time distracting   us from our worries and troubles.

Zoo keepers have always had problems getting the animals to leave their cages in order for the cages to be cleaned, and also training them to move indoors when appropriate. Another problem was that many of the large animals became _ and bored. In the last twenty years, scientists have done research on dolphins and whales, training them to obey commands. The scientists found they could get animals to obey by rewarding them with food and affection when they responded correctly.\nProper training allows the animals to receive the care they need. It was very difficult to get untrained animals, especially the larger ones, to stay still when they needed medical attention. Now they can be trained, on command, to remain still and even to allow blood samples to be taken and shots administered. All this is accomplished through positive reinforcement, without the use of any force. Affection training, as this process is called, has been used with great success on a wide variety of zoo animals. Animal behavior experts have taught zoo keepers to train bears, tigers, monkeys, and many other species to behave in a way that provides for better animal-keeper interaction.

Most countries, including the United States, have used a measure called the gross national product  or GNP. It includes all goods and services produced by citizens of the country anywhere in the world.\nRecently the American Commerce Department has started using a new method to measure production. It is known as the gross domestic product or GDP. It counts only goods and services that have been produced within the nation's borders. Money earned by foreign companies operating in the United States is included in the GDP, but money earned by American companies operating in other countries is not.\nEconomic experts generally approve of the change. They say that the gross domestic product provides a truer measure of the economy. They also note that most other industrial countries use this method. Therefore it will be easier to study the economies of different countries. Some officials also hope the new system will help them make better economic policy decisions. It will provide them with a clearer understanding of economic activity in the U.S. . The new measure is less likely to be affected by sudden changes in foreign oil prices or in the value of the American dollar in other countries.\nEconomic experts believe that the change from GNP to GDP will immediately reduce the value of American production by at least 40,000 million dollars a year. But that is really a very small change in the American economy - less than 1% . The Commerce Department reports the unofficial gross domestic product once every three months.

Helping them enjoy science can be easy; there is no need for a lot of scientific terms or expensive lab equipment. You only have to share your children's curiosity. Firstly, listen to their questions. I once visited a classroom of seven -year- olds to talk about science as a job. The children asked me \"textbook questions\" about schooling, salary and whether I liked my job. When I finished answering, we sat facing one another in science. Finally I said,\" Now that we've finished with your lists, do you have questions of your own about science?\"\nAfter a long pause, a boy raised his hand, \"have you ever seen a grasshopper eat? When I try eating leaves like that, I get a stomachache. Why?\"\nThis began a set of questions that lasted nearly two hours.\nSecondly, give them time to think. Studies over the past 30 years have shown that. After asking a question, adults typically wait only one second or less for an answer, no time for a child to think. When adults increase their \"wait time\" to three seconds or more, children give more logical, complete and creative answers.\nThirdly, watch your language. Once you have a child involved in a science discussion, don't jump in with \"That's right\" or \"very good\". These words work well when it comes to encouraging good behavior. But in talking about science, quick praise can signal that discussion is over. Instead, keep things going by saying, \"That's interesting\" or \"I'd never thought of it that way before', or coming up with more questions or ideas.\nNever push a child to \"think\". It doesn't make sense; children are always thinking, without your telling them to. What's more, this can turn a conversation into a performance. The child will try to find the answer you want, in as few words as possible, so that he will be a small target for your disagreement.\nLastly, show; don't tell. Real-life impressions of nature are far more impressive than any lesson children can learn from a book or a television program. Let children look at their fingertips through a magnifying glass, and they'll understand why you want them to wash before dinner.

Instead, many foreigners come to Shanghai to settle in the city. They are attracted by the life in Shanghai and choose to stay in the city. Their stay has made Shanghai more like an international city.\nEarly in the 1990s, a group of Western-style buildings _ at the Gubei New District in the southwestern part of the Hongqiao Development Zone in Shanghai.

It is true that children used to take part in outdoor sports and games. Today many young people stay inside watching television, playing computer games, or surfing the Internet. Rarely can people see children today, enjoying themselves outdoors, on playgrounds or even in neighborhoods.\n   Young people who join in after-school sports activities will be out of the house. They will be on the move, running and jumping, which is great exercise. They will learn discipline and the importance of being a team player, whey they are part of an organized sport. They also learn about good sportsmanship, teamwork and gaining confidence. There are even sports that young athletes do better in school. Outdoor sports give children, teens and young adults the opportunity for fresh air and sunshine, which improve their over-all health. They will obtain Vitamin D from the sun, and burn extra calories which will help prevent obesity  . It is important that a child enjoy what he or she is doing.\n   Children do better in sports events, when they have a healthy desire and a natural ability for a particular activity. While track and field events may not be some small children's cup of tea, there were other children who enjoyed themselves and received rewards. The Rhodes family joined in the Subway Commonwealth Games for the first time. The 3 siblings took home 2 medals each, for a total of 6. Eight-year-old Jerel Rhodes II, won gold medals for the shot put  , and the discus   throw. Seven-year-old Jadyn Rhodes, received a silver medal fro the shot put, and a bronze medal in the 400-meter race. Five-year-old Jase Rhodes took home the gold medal in the 800-meter race, as well as the discuss throw.\n   There is a down side to athletic activities. Not everyone will go home as a winner. If your child does not win a medal, you should not complain about him or her. You should be proud of him or her just for taking part. If a child feels bad about his or her performance, he or she may be teased by other children, or his or her parents may express disappointment. All these can have an effect on self-esteem. The bottom line is to get your children out of the house, and to be involved in activities that keep them moving. Playing on the playground or playing games such as hide and seek can be fun for all. If your child is indeed a young athlete in the making, encourage --but do not push -- him or her to take advantage of organized competitive sports.\nThe Mayo Clinic, an internationally famous medical research group, says that all children should be encouraged to be active in sports. Pushing boys and girls into areas where they are not comfortable, or they do not have the athletic ability could have the worst effect on them.

First and foremost, plastic isn't recyclable. Secondly, it contains toxins   helping develop cancerous diseases. Finally, it's made of oil and oil reserves aren't endless.\nThe liquid wood technology is likely to replace plastic and providing mankind with new materials for many years ahead.

Once mixed with several other matenals, it turns into solid and non-toxic _ for plastics.\nICT team leader Emilia Regina Inone-Kauffmann said the wood-working industry separates wood into three basic components, including lignin.

It can be used for the production of any items. Arboform is already used for the production of car parts which require extra strength. In addition, liquid wood can be recycled repeatedly. The material preserved all of its qualities even if it's reprocessed ten times.\nHowever, the new invention doesn't enjoy an extensive use due to the high content of sulfur  in it.

This tradition is still commonly practiced today in most parts of the world largely for practical purposes (most people are right handed.)It is worn on the fourth finger of the left hand. But there are some countries and groups which do not follow this tradition.  In the Jewish faith, the wedding ring is put on the index finger. Roman Catholics traditionally wore their wedding band on the right hand, and in many countries and regions in Europe some people still follow this tradition.\nIt is interesting to note that in the long history of the wedding ring that it is only in the last century that men have begun to wear them. However, now both men and women show their love and commitment by exchanging rings on their wedding day.\nOnce you begin shopping for rings you may be amazed by the choices that await you.

So I was really scared she was going to refuse my offer again. I know some people have a hard time understanding how the possibility of rejection can make an adult so afraid, but that's just the way I felt.\nThen, I reminded myself of how good I had felt yesterday when I'd done some acts of kindness after telling myself: Feel the fear, and do it anyway! So I put the cookies on a beautiful plate, opened my apartment door--and there she was, standing in the hallway. But when she saw me, she went back inside. I went after her and quickly said, \"I'm sorry, I've got something for you! I just wanted to tell you how grateful I am that you were paying attention on Monday.\" When she heard me speaking, she turned around. As I held the plate towards her, her eyebrows winged up and she took the plate. I was so happy and excited.\nBack in my place, I did a \"happy dance\", because I had dared to be kind even though I hadn't been sure my kindness would be welcome. I do hope that our relationship will slowly get better. I know I was and still am biased   towards her at times, but even if we don't make amends, I want to be able to be kind without depending on other people's behaviors and reactions.", "id": "high4674.txt"}, {"answers": ["C", "A", "B"], "options": [["Listen to some music.", "Ignore it and do something else.", "Just do nothing and truly feel that emotion.", "Think about it and try to deal with it immediately."], ["Clear Your Mental Space.", "Deep Breath, Trouble Away.", "Try to Avoid the Negative Emotion.", "Keep Holding on to This Negative Emotion as Long as Possible."], ["doubtful", "optimistic", "frightened", "confused"]], "questions": ["What should you do when you are into negativity according to the article?", "What's the best title of this text?", "The author's opinion towards negative emotion is   _  ."], "article": "Think about the last time you felt a negative emotion--like stress, anger, or frustration.

Whatever you're doing, stop and sit for one minute. While you're sitting there, completely _ yourself in the negative emotion.\nAllow that emotion to consume you.

Allow yourself another minute to feel the emotion.\nWhen you feel you've had enough of the emotion, ask yourself if you're willing to carry that negativity with you for the rest of the day. If not, take a deep breath. As you exhale, release all that negativity with your breath.\nThis exercise seems simple--almost too simple. But, it is very effective. By allowing that negative emotion the space to be truly felt, you are dealing with the emotion rather than stuffing it down and trying not to feel it. You are actually taking away the power of the emotion by giving it the space and attention it needs.

One of nature's great mysteries is why the zebra has stripes  . One theory is that the stripes help the zebra cool down. On hot days the black stripes get a lot hotter than the white area of the zebra and under the black stripes there are special layers of fat for protection. Hot air then rises off the black stripes, forcing colder air down around the white areas, cooling the zebra down. This, however, is just a kind of theory. The stripes can also confuse predators(,) when zebras stay with other animals in great numbers. \nZebras have excellent hearing and eyesight and can run at speeds of up to 56 kilometers per hour. They also have a powerful kick that can cause serious injury to a predator, like a lion, or an African wild dog. Usually the lead male of the herd stays at the back of the group to defend against predators if necessary, while the females and youngsters escape danger.\nZebras are herbivores that feed only on plants and live mostly by eating grasses, although they also might eat a bit on the leaves and stems  of bushes. They eat grasses for many hours each day, using their strong teeth. Spending so much time chewing wears the zebras' teeth down, so their teeth keep growing all their lives. As the dry season arrives and the grasses die back, zebra herds travel to find more food and water holes for drinking. Most zebras have no specific territories.

For bees and the plants they pollinate   -- as well as for beekeepers, farmers, honey lovers and everyone else who appreciates this marvelous social insect -- this is a catastrophe.\nHoneybee collapse has been particularly worrying because there is no one cause, but rather a thousand little cuts. The main elements include the mixed impact of pesticides   applied to fields, as well as pesticides applied directly into nets to control bugs, pests and diseases; nutritional shortages caused by vast acreages of single-crop fields that lack diverse flowering plants; and commercial beekeeping itself, which destroys groups by moving most bees around the country multiple times each year to pollinate crops.\nThe real issue, though, is not the volume of problems, but the interactions among them. Here we find a major lesson from the bees that we ignore at our risk: the concept of synergy  , where one plus one equals three, or four, or more. A typical honeybee colony contains remains from more than 120 pesticides. Alone, each represents a benign dose  . But together they form a poisonous soup of chemicals whose interplay   can greatly reduce the effectiveness of bees' immune systems, making them easier to suffer from diseases.\nObserving the death of honeybees should warn us that our own well-being might be similarly threatened, and the widespread collapse of so many groups presents a clear message: We must demand that our regulatory authorities require studies on how exposure to low dosages of combined chemicals may affect human health before approving compounds.\nBees also provide some clues to how we may build a more collaborative relationship with the services that ecosystems can provide. Bees could offer some of the pollination service needed for agriculture. People discovered that crop harvests, and thus profits, are maximized if some cropland are left uncultivated for bees.

Some of them were given a 12-minute break while the others were not allowed any break from the task. People on the break did not simply relax - some of them were told to carry out a tiring memory task while others did an easier task.\nScientists found that people who did the easier task were daydreaming a lot. They thought about personal issues   in the past or in the future because their mind was at ease  .\nAfter the break, all participants were asked to return once again to the task of listing unusual uses for everyday objects. It was found that daydreamers improved their performance by 40percent, while all the other people, including those who didn't have a break and who did tiring tasks during the break, performed the same as before.\n\"People assume that when the mind wanders away it just gets turned off - but we show the opposite,\" explained Christoff. \"A more playful attitude might allow you to call in more resources .\" So when you are struggling to solve complicated problems, it might be better off if you switch to a simpler task and let your mind\nAccording to Christoff, people typically   spend one-third of their waking time daydreaming. \"It's a big part of our lives, but it's been largely ignored by science.\"", "id": "high18953.txt"}, {"answers": ["D", "A", "C", "B", "A"], "options": [["expecting the readers' reply", "gathering readers' information", "asking the readers' for help", "introducing the theme"], ["to provide more accurate road conditions quickly", "to have a better idea of passers--byes privacy", "to protect the capital from being attacked", "to keep an eye on helicopters or highways"], ["the high--tech traffic data systems is of little use for traffic jam", "the Solar--powered sensors can get rid of all traffic problems", "the system can cause drivers to be more aware of road conditions", "the facilities can change a person's fortune in the near future"], ["the city ofWashingtonuses the data for traffic planning for free", "broadcasters and companies get the information without pay", "highway patrol accident reports often come 30 to 40 minutes late", "Finlay tries to persuade people to use their collected data"], ["solar--powered sensors that provide traffic data", "Speedlnfo Inc. that produces radar sensors", "a business model that will develope around U.

Even today, many people in the world go hungry, and even die of hunger. If we are to grow enough for everybody, we have to grow more crops and better crops.\nPlants need the right food in order to grow. In particular, they need three chemical substances   in the soil: nitrogen  , phosphorus   and potassium  . They also need smaller amounts of other chemical substances like calcium. If there is too little of any of these substances in the soil, plants can't grow well.\nWhen a plant grows, it takes up these basic substances from the soil and builds them into itself.

That means many people are competing for the same things, like good jobs. They say that to be successful, a person has to work like a dog. This means they have to work very, very hard. Such hard work can make people dog-tired. And, the situation would be even worse if they became sick as a dog.\nStill, people say every dog has its day. This means that every person enjoys a successful period during his or her life. To be successful, people often have to learn new skills.

They believe that older people do not like to learn new things and will not change the way they do things.\nSome people are compared to dogs in bad ways. People who are unkind or uncaring can be described meaner than a junkyard dog. Junkyard dogs live in places where people throw away things they do not want. Mean dogs are often used to guard this property. They bark or attack people who try to enter the property. However, sometimes a person who appears to be mean and threatening is really not so bad. We say his bark is worse than his bite.\nHusbands and wives use this doghouse term when they are angry at each other. For example, a woman might get angry at her husband for coming home late or forgetting their wedding anniversary. She might tell him that he is in the doghouse. She may not treat him nicely until he apologizes. However, the husband may decide that it is best to leave things alone and not create more problems. He might decide to let sleeping dogs lie.\nDog expressions also are used to describe the weather. The dog days of summer are the hottest days of the year. A rainstorm may cool the weather.

With two hours of hard work, the crew skillfully pulled the creature into a net and dragged it aboard their ship.\nScientists estimate   that the animal weighs about a half ton and is about 40 feet long.

What scientists do know from studying the bodies of a half dozen colossal squids is that they are fierce hunters.\nThe recently captured colossal squid has been frozen to keep it for scientific study. It will be transported to New Zealand's national museum, Te Papa, in the capital city of Wellington. Experts believe it to be the first adult male ever caught undamaged.

One was carrying 69 passengers from Toronto, the other 176 passengers from Chicago. An air traffic controller noticed on his radar screen that the two planes were too close to each other. He ordered one to turn to the right and to climb. But he made a mistake. He ordered the wrong plane to do this. So, instead of turning away from the second plane, the first plane turned towards it.

The kids had to find the small shapes while sitting in a room with either cheerful or sad music playing in the background. To test their mood, the scientists asked the kids to point to one of five faces, from happy to sad. Children who listened to cheerful music tended to point to the smiley faces while the others pointed to the unhappy ones. The researchers found that sad kids took at least a second less to find the small shapes. They also found an average of three or four more shapes.\nIn the second experiment, 61 children watched one of two scenes from a film. One scene was happy, and the other was sad. Just like in the first experiment, kids who saw the sad scene acted better compared to the others.\nThe researchers guessed that feeling down makes people more likely to focus on a problem or difficult situation. Not all scientists agree with them, however. Other studies argued that maybe, that cheerful music in the first experimentdistracted   kids from finding shapes.\nWhile scientists work on finding out the answers, it still might be wise to choose when to do your tasks according to your mood.

We can put on more clothes, stay next to a fireplace, turn on the air conditioner or simply travel to a warmer city to spend the winter - people have many different ways of dealing with the cold.\nBut things are not as easy for plants. Unlike humans, plants can't move to escape the cold or generate heat ( ) to keep themselves warm. So how do they manage to survive the freezing winter?\nIt turns out that plants have their own strategies   too, said a study published on Dec 22 in the journal Nature.\nAccording to researcher Amy Zanne of George Washington University, US, the cold is a big challenge for plants. Their living tissues   can be damaged when they freeze. \"It's like a plant's equivalent to frostbite ( ),\" Zanne told Science Daily. Also, the process of freezing and thawing    can cause air bubbles   to form in the plant's water transport system. \"If enough of these air bubbles come together as water thaws they can block the flow of water from the roots to the leaves and kill the plant,\" she explained.\nTo live through cold weather, plants have developed three traits   , according to the study. Some plants, such as oak trees , avoid freezing damage by dropping their leaves before the winter chill sets in - effectively shutting off the flow of water between roots and leaves - and growing new leaves and water transport cells when the warm spring returns.\nOther plants, pine trees  for example, protect themselves by narrowing their water transport cells, which makes it easier for cells to travel among air bubbles.\nThe third strategy is also the most extreme - some plants die on the ground in winter and start growing as new plants from seeds when conditions get warmer.\nHowever, the study also found that these smart strategies were developed very slowly - over millions\nof years of evolution ( ). This leads scientists to worry that plants may not be able to deal with human-caused climate change, which has only started occurring over the past few decades.\nScientists are hoping that this study can help people find possible ways to save plants from the threat\nof climate change.", "id": "high7197.txt"}, {"answers": ["C", "B", "D"], "options": [["His dream of being an inventor.", "The support of his wife.", "The greatly increasing usage of the Internet.", "The successful boss that he admired."], ["the boss thought the idea was suitable for the author", "the author might not regret if he failed the attempt", "the author wanted someone else to try the idea", "the author might go back to his boss if he failed"], ["Cleverness and Kindness", "The Starting of Amazon", "Following My Passion", "We Are What We Choose"]], "questions": ["What inspired the author with the idea of building an online bookstore?", "We can know from the passage that   _  .", "Which of the following would be the best title for the passage?"], "article": "Cleverness is a gift while kindness is a choice.

than overjoyed by a daily bombardment of playing.I imagined my father in his study,cotton wads in his ears.\nI worked my way through several other instruments before my mother hit on another

from my sense of injury,I realized the wisdom of his choice.I loved the active,practical backstage world,and I discovered that I had a knack for constructing and painting.I loved the challenge of taking our scanty supplies and using them to make something beautiful.Imagining a scene and then seeing it emerge before me-this,to me,was close to magic.\nI'm a sculptor now,and every day I experience afresh the joy of being fully absorbed in the act of artistic creation.It's a wonderful,blissful  feeling.I realize that my parents,in their misguided attempts to interest me in music,were

He clapped loudly. \"You're looking strong. Keep going--go, go, go!\"\nYou bet I'm looking strong, I thought, as I followed my younger sister, Laura. I just got started. She had been diligently clocking eight-minute miles since the race had begun downtown. Initially in the middle of a pack, which was several thousand people, she had been steadily passing other runners for the past 10 miles or so. We were now on the relatively steep rise to the St. Cecelia Bridge. Once we crossed, we would begin heading back into town, running along the east side of the Rincon River. Laura had asked me to run the most difficult section of the marathon with her. Not having trained for anything more challenging than a quick walk, and with no experience running in organized events, I figured I might be good for two or three miles.\nUp ahead, steel drums were playing. A group of drummers was beating their drums, chanting, and encouraging us with their music and smiles. Crossing the bridge, I recalled the advice in the Marathon Handbook. During my preview of the route, it had seemed like a babyish thing to do. But now it seemed like a fine idea, and I spat magnificently over the side of the bridge.\n\"I read the handbook, too!\" said a woman behind me, who also let loose over the side of the bridge. We had now started a chain reaction of bridge spitters. It was quite a sight, but I had other things to occupy my attention, namely the back of Laura's sweater.\nEasing off the bridge, and heading south on Avila Boulevard, Laura and I found our pace together again. Here we could hang to the left of the group and enjoy some brief conversation. \"You keeping up okay?\" she asked. Being her older brother, and therefore unable to admit weakness, I nodded convincingly.\n\"Hey, Lee!\" yelled a waving man on the sidewalk. Immediately pleased that my marathon efforts had been recognized by someone I knew, I waved back and reflected on the importance of wearing tie-dyed clothing to a road race of this size. It made it a lot easier to be spotted!\nThe town marathon is a \"people's\" marathon in that it tends to be a family affair, with the runners and spectators creating a festival atmosphere. I managed to run six miles before bowing out, and Laura finished the entire race in under four hours. I now pride myself on telling people that I ran in a marathon. The distinction between having run a marathon and having run in a marathon seems unimportant. If pressed, however, I'll admit that I only ran one-fourth of one.\nInspired by this year's experience, I plan to walk the course--really fast--next year. It's not because I'm jealous of my sister's accomplishment. This is not some silly competition in which I must do whatever she does.

Promising to begin something new is a common New Year resolution for many school teenagers.\nMost schools offer different kinds of hobby classes. Students take them in their free periods or after school. Some classes you have to pay for and others are free of charge. For example, I once took a free Wednesday evening gymnastics class that my school offered. But when I learnt how to play the drum my parents had to pay for the lesson, and they did so, like most parents, without any complaint.\nThe most popular extra classes at my school were piano lessons and drama club:  Both classes offered exams students could take. Because the extra classes may take up much time of the students, students with many hobbies sometimes felt more stressed than those without any. But they could enjoy their life better than those who didn't foster   any hobbies at school. For example, they could build up good friendship with the persons who shared the common interest with them. Most important of all, the students with hobbies left school with many extra skills.\nFrankly speaking, I haven't continued any of the hobbies I began at school.

It's the first really warm day of the year, an unexpected heat that bridges the gap between spring and summer. Father and son are on their way to the barbershop, something they have always done together.\nAlways, the routine is the same. \"It's about time we got that mop of yours cut,\" David's dad will say, pointing at him with two fingers, a cigarette caught between them. \"Perhaps I should do it. Where are those scissors, Janet?\" Sometimes his dad runs after him round the living room, pretending to cut off his ears. When he was young, David used to get too excited and start crying, scared that maybe he really would lose his ears, but he has long since grown out of that.\nMr Samuels' barbershop is in a long room above the chip shop, reached by a steep and worn flight of stairs. David follows his father. He loves the barbershop -- it's like nowhere else he goes. It smells of cigarettes and men and hair oil. Sometimes the smell of chips will climb the stairs along with a customer and when the door opens the waiting men lift their noses together. Black and white photographs of men with various out-of-fashion hairstyles hang above a picture rail at the end of the room, where two barber's chairs are fixed to the floor. They are heavy, old-fashioned chairs with foot pumps that screams as Mr Samuels adjusts the height of the seat. In front of the chairs are deep sinks with a showerhead and long metal pipe attached to the taps, not that anyone seems to use them. Behind the sinks are mirrors and on either side of these, shelves overflowing with all types of plastic combs, shaving mugs, scissors, cut throat razors, hair brushes and, 10 bright red bottles of Brylcreem , piled neatly in a pyramid. At the back of the room sit the customers, silent for most of the time, except when Mr Samuels breaks off from cutting and smoke his cigarette, sending a stream of grey-blue smoke like the tail of kite twisting into the air.\nWhen it is David's turn for a cut, Mr Samuels places a wooden board covered with a piece of red leather across the arms of the chair, so that the barber doesn't have to bend to cut the boy's hair. David scrambles up onto the bench.\n\"Hey, young man, you're shooting up, you won't need this soon, you'll be able to sit in the chair,\" the barber says.\n\"Wow,\" says David, turning round to look at his dad, forgetting that he can see him through the mirror. \"Dad, Mr Samuels said I could be sitting in the chair soon, not just on the board!\"\n\"So I hear,\" his father replies, not looking up from the paper. _ \n\"At least double the price,\" said Mr Samuels, winking at David.\nFinally David's dad looks up from his newspaper and glances into the mirror, seeing his son looking back at him. He smiles.\n\"Wasn't so long ago when I had to lift you onto that board because you couldn't climb up there yourself,\" he says.\n\"They don't stay young for long do they, kids\", Mr Samuels declares. All the men in the shop nod in agreement. David nods too.\nIn the mirror he sees a little head sticking out of a long nylon cape. Occasionally he steals glances at the barber as he works. He smells a mixture of smelly sweat and aftershave as the barber moves around him, combing and cutting, combing and cutting.\nDavid feels like he is in another world, noiseless except for the sound of the barber's shoes rubbing on the plastic carpet and the click of his scissors. In the reflection from the window he could see through the window, a few small clouds moved slowly through the frame, moving to the sound of the scissors' click.\nSleepily, his eyes dropping to the front of the cape where his hair falls softly as snow and he imagines sitting in the chair just like the men and older boys, the special bench left leaning against the wall in the corner. He thinks about the picture book of Bible stories his aunt gave him for Christmas, the one of Samson having his hair cut by Delilah. David wonders if his strength will go like Samson's.\nWhen Mr Samuels has finished, David hops down from the seat, rubbing the itchy hair from his face. Looking down he sees his own thick, blonde hair mixed among the browns, greys and blacks of the men who have sat in the chair before him. _ \nThey reach the pavement outside the shop. \"I tell you what, boy, let's get some fish and chips to take home, save your mum from cooking tea,\" says David's dad and turns up the street.\nThe youngster is excited and catches his dad's hand.

Although the process has been going on since you went to middle school, the biggest change is going to take place. Now, instead of taking several subjects, you have chosen one major subject because you find it interesting and worth exploring further. The choice was yours. You also have before you the goal of getting a degree. The degree, and the stages you have to pass through to achieve it, give you motivation, even though it may become weak from time to time, and not all parts of the course will be exciting; a sure way to lose interest is to do too little work. It is a law of diminishing returns---the less work you do, the less interest you will have and the more bored you will become. So regular work is needed to keep your interest as well as keep pace with new work.\n   Another change is in the relationship with those who teach you. This may well have changed during middle school and high school, but now the whole context is different. You are no longer forced to stay in school all day, and you organize your own time and place for studying. You are there to study actively rather than to be taught passively. Your teachers may or may not urge you, but they do want you to share their interest in the subject and they want you to succeed.\n   The teacher works as your coach or trainer. If you were becoming a professional tennis player or musician, you would expect your coach to look out for ways of improving your performance, and to criticize your work all the time; you would be silly to feel fed up about this---in fact you would  _ your coach if he just said everything was fine. So if you get work back with a poorer mark than you expected and with various criticisms, don't feel discouraged by this.

Now a similar principle is being employed to create an umbrella that protects people from the rain using nothing more than an invisible air force field.\nAir Umbrella, developed by a Chinese company and recently funded by Kickstarter, uses forced air rather than fabric to create a protective canopy that keeps people from getting wet in the rain.\nIt's a clever concept and designers have done a good job of answering several questions about the product. For instance, the sound generated by the device is minimal, especially when compared to the pitter-patter of the falling rain. It can create a protective canopy wide enough for two people to fit under and it performs well even in the heavy rain. The air shield   can be cut through by high winds, but given that regular umbrellas typically fold over in similar windy conditions, the air umbrella is still an upgrade.\nA few concerns do remain, however. For instance, the battery life is only about 15-30 minutes depending on the model, so you'll still want to walk briskly to your next destination when it's raining. Also, while the air shield might keep the rain away from you, it's likely to splash all that blown-away water onto anyone else like a sprinkler  . So the device might draw the _ of anyone else walking with you, or any helpless bystanders.\nThere are currently three different types to choose from if you're interested in investing. Air Umbrella-A is the lightest model, and is apparently designed specifically for females, according to the Chinese developers. It is about 12 inches in length and weighs a little over a pound, and it runs for 15 minutes per charge. Air Umbrella-B measures nearly 20 inches long and weighs 1.7 pounds, and lasts 30 minutes per charge. Finally, Air Umbrella-C also lasts 30 minutes, but is scalable between 20 and 32 inches depending on your needs.", "id": "high14547.txt"}, {"answers": ["B", "A", "C", "B"], "options": [["36", "12", "20", "15"], ["their academic performance will affect their future careers", "they are heavily involved in student affairs", "they have to obey university discipline", "they want to run for positions of authority"], ["they hate the constant pressure and strain of their study", "they will then be able to stay longer in the university", "such positions help them get better jobs", "such positions are usually well paid"], ["dealing with the academic affairs of the university", "ensuring that the students obey university regulations", "evaluating students' performance by bringing them before a court", "keeping up the students' enthusiasm for social activities."]], "questions": ["Normally a student would at least attend   _   classes each week.", "American university students are usually under pressure of work because   _  .", "Some students are enthusiastic for position in student organizations probably because   _  .", "The student organizations seem to be effective in    _  ."], "article": "Normally a student must attend a certain number of courses in order to graduate, and each course which he attends gives him a credit which he may count towards a degree.

Normally a student would expect to take four years attending two semesters each year. It is possible to spread the period of work for the degree over a longer period. It is also possible for a student to move between one university and another during his degree course, though this is not in fact done as a regular practice.\nFor every course that he follows a student is given a grade, which is recorded, and the record is available for the student to show to future employers. All this imposes a constant pressure and stress of work, but in spite of this some students still find time for great activity in student affairs. Elections to positions in student organizations arouse much enthusiasm. The effective work of maintaining discipline is usually performed by students who advise the academic authorities. Any student who is thought to have broken the rules, for example, by cheating has to appear before a student court.

Some top-end restaurants will add a 10% service charge to the bill. If not, waiters will appreciate you tacking on  the 10% yourself. However, if you're eating at a lower-end  restaurant a tip is not necessary. If you're staying at one of Bangkok's many five-star hotels, expect to tip the porter 20 to 50 baht , depending on how many bags you have. Taxis are now metered in Bangkok. Local custom is to round the fare  up to the nearest five baht.\nHong Kong\nTipping is customary in this money-mad metropolis . Most restaurants add a 10% service charge to the bill, but the extra money often ends up in the pocket of the owner. If the service is good, add another 10% to the bill, up to HK $100 in an especially nice restaurant. For HK $10 hotel porters should do it at all but the nicest hotels where a new HK $20 bill may be more acceptable. When in a taxi, round up  to the nearest dollar.\nKuala Lumpur\nTipping in Malaysia is limited to the expensive Westernized hotels, which often add a 10% service charge to your meal or hotel room. If you are at a hotel restaurant, expect a 10% service charge. But at local restaurants, there's no need to add a tip. At five-star hotels, one or two ringgit  will content a porter. At lower-end buildings don't feel you have to tip. Like Bangkok, many taxis are now metered so you can just round up to the nearest ringgit.\nSeoul\nTipping is not part of Korean culture, although it has become a matter of course in international hotels where a 10% service charge is often added. If you're at a Korean barbecue joint , there's no need to add anything extra. But a nice Italian restaurant may require a 10% contribution. If you're at a top-end hotel, so expect to pay 500~1 000 won per bag. Taxi drivers don't accept a tip.

The course titles will be Yoga for Teenagers; Hip Hop Dance: Learning the Latest Moves; and Creative Journaling for Teens: Discovering the Writer Within. The latter course will not be held at the Allendale Cultural Center but instead will meet at the Allendale Public Library.\nStaff member Tricia Cousins will teach the yoga and hip hop classes. Ms. Cousins is an accomplished choreographer   as well as an experienced dance educator. She has an MA in dance education from Teachers College, Columbia University, where she wrote a thesis on the pedagogical   effectiveness of dance education. The journaling class will be taught by Betsy Milford. Ms. Milford is the head librarian at the Allendale Public Library as well as a columnist for the professional journal Library Focus.\nThe courses are part of the Allendale Cultural Center's Project Teen, which was initiated by Leah Martin, Director of the Cultural Center. According to Martin, this project is a direct result of her efforts to make the center a more essential part of the Allendale community. Over the last several years, the number of people who have visited the cultural center for classes or events has steadily declined. Project Teen is primarily funded by a generous grant from The McGee Arts Foundation, an organization devoted to bringing arts programs to young adults. Martin oversees the Project Teen board, which consists of five board members. Two board members are students at Allendale's Brookdale High School; the other three are adults with backgrounds in education and the arts.\nThe creative journaling class will be cosponsored by Brookdale High School, and students who complete the class will be given the opportunity to publish one of their journal entries in Pulse, Brookdale's student literary magazine. Students who complete the hip hop class will be eligible to participate in the Allendale Review, an annual concert sponsored by the cultural center that features local actors, musicians, and dancers. All classes are scheduled to begin immediately following school dismissal, and transportation will be available from Brookdale High School to the Allendale Cultural Center and the Allendale Public Library.

For each word he drew a picture. But that proved impossible -- there were just too many words. Then he took the 85 sounds that made up the language. Using his own imagination and an English spelling book, Sequoyah invented a sign for each sound. His alphabet proved amazingly easy to learn. Before long, many Cherokees knew how to read and write in their own language. By 1828, they were even printing their own newspaper.\nIn 1830, the U.S. Congress passed a law. It allowed the government to remove Indians from their lands. The Cherokees refused to go. They had lived on their lands for centuries. It belonged to them.

My father was in his forties at that time and I was about twelve years old. He was always working hard trying to support us seven kids. I enjoyed hanging out with him whenever I could -- he taught me so much.\nWe arrived at the call and after walking over snow and ice, we knocked on the customer's door. A senior citizen opened the door and let us into her very cold home. She was wearing an old, worn-out brown coat that went down to her knees. On her head, covering her gray hair, was an old and worn hat. The home wasn't furnished very well and was quite dark, except for a single light bulb over the dining room table. Below the light was an older man counting change from several old coffee cans. He looked up at us as we passed by to get to the kitchen where my dad would fix the oil burner. He didn't say anything. He just looked up at us. He couldn't speak English, nor could his wife. She only pointed to the kitchen and smiled at us.\nAfter a short while, my father had the heater up and running, and it began to heat their cold home. The lady asked my dad in poor English how much she owed him for fixing the heater. My dad looked around the house and said that he had to go out to the truck and write the bill.\nOnce in the truck he marked the bill \"no answer at home, no charge\", so they wouldn't be charged for his work. He looked over at me and said, \"He was counting his change to pay me. They need their money more than I do.\"\nAs usual, my father taught me something important that time, which was to be kind to the poor.", "id": "high11904.txt"}, {"answers": ["B", "D"], "options": [["enable people to save more money for future use", "help people develop environmentally friendly habits", "prevent people from making changes in their daily routine", "warn people against reducing consumption of consumer products"], ["Earth Day was first celebrated over half a century ago", "short term decisions will by no means influence our lives", "Earth Day Canada is actually an everyday environmental action", "daily actions must be measured to benefit the environment"]], "questions": ["The aim of the campaign mentioned in the passage is to  _  .", "We can conclude from the passage that   ."], "article": "The \"Give It Up for Earth Day\" encourages people to commit to giving up actions that are harmful to the environment, such as using poisonous cleaners.\nThroughout the month of April, Canadians are being asked to \"Give It Up for Earth Day!\" Earth Day has been celebrated every year on April 22 since 1970.

Later on,when they asked railway officials to take them up to look at the High Line,they saw a mile and a half of wild flowers growing in the middle of the city,and they realized that the High Line had potential to become a park.There was growing interest in improving urban centers,and so the project quickly gathered funds for construction.\nThe first section of the High Line opened in 2009 and immediately became popular with tourists and locals alike.Each part of the park has a different atmosphere.Some areas are like balconies with wonderful city views.Other sections have wide lawns and walkways planted with wild flowers.Only the final section remains the way it has been for the last fifty years--a railway line overgrown with weeds.", "id": "high6607.txt"}, {"answers": ["C", "B"], "options": [["teachers focus on students' mistakes", "students dissatisfied with their teachers", "students not take tests seriously at all", "teachers lose confidence in their students"], ["tests are a wining or losing game between students and teachers", "tests should help students find areas where they are struggling", "tests are a tool to check what students have memorized", "tests should be a mark to end a learning course"]], "questions": ["According to what Guskey said, the culture of classroom testing makes   _  .", "The writer seems to support the statement that   _  ."], "article": "As teachers, most of us have been taught that tests are the best way to assess our students' learning and the effectiveness of our teaching. But when a student scores poorly on a test, how does he or she benefit? The student loses confidence and ends up feeling \"stupid\". I believe we can use tests to improve learning, not just check what our students have memorized. \nI recently attended a conference where the speaker, Thomas Guskey, challenged us to consider how we might change the culture of classroom testing. Guskey asked, \"What happens to these tests? What educational purpose do they serve?\" His point was that teachers typically grade test papers, give them back, and then move on. Students put their test papers away and never look at them again. Some students will even make a show of walking leisurely to the trash to crumple and toss their test papers into the bin. If a student feels like he or she studied hard for a test and still got a bad grade, he or she can become disheartened with the classroom cycle that consists of teaching and testing, teaching and testing. \nMany times, testing simply feels like a winning or losing game between students and their teachers. I'll never forget the day my son and I were discussing testing in one of his least favorite classes (and with his least favorite teacher) and he looked me square in the eyes and said, \"Mom, I refuse to play the game.\" My son was in honors classes, yet he felt this way! Would it be regarded as less of a game if students had a chance to retake the test, or work out where they'd gone wrong?\nThere is an argument for the exam as the final assessment: if students don't have the knowledge by the time they're tested, that's unfortunate, but it's time to move on -- there's only so much time to teach the material. \"What about surgeons  ? Do they 'test' their learning on a genuine patient?\" Guskey asked. \"Or do they get to check their learning on a dead body to make sure they've got it worked out?\" You wouldn't show a surgeon a heart bypass in a textbook and then send him or her straight into the operating room!\nBy moving on immediately after giving an exam, we're missing a valuable opportunity to teach our students exactly what they need to learn! Rather than a game in which students either win or lose, we can turn testing into a win-win classroom experience by giving students the opportunity to learn from their mistakes. We can change the culture in our classrooms by using tests as a tool to improve learning rather than marking the end of the learning process.", "id": "high20135.txt"}, {"answers": ["C", "D", "C"], "options": [["the lady didn't want to charge the author for his lunch", "the author knew Mr.Walker was right behind him", "Mr.Walker didn't know the author was his student", "the author decided to invite Mr Walker to lunch"], ["His parents met Mr.Walker by chance.", "His family invited Mr.Walker to lunch.", "Mr.Walker brought an unexpected guest.", "His parents came together with Mr.Walker."], ["The author had invited Mr.Walker to his graduation ceremony.", "The author's parents had informed him of Mr.Walker's visit.", "Mr.Walker had a very close relationship with his students.", "Mr.Walker went to visit the author frequently."]], "questions": ["At the dining hall,", "What happened on the author's graduation day?", "What can we infer from the last sentence?"], "article": "My first day of high school was like any other first day: registering? finding new classmates, meeting new teachers, and seeking new friends.\nDuring lunch, I ran into my first snag of the day.At the dining hall, as the checkout lady asked for my money, I realized that I had forgotten my lunch money  .When I told her about it, I heard a voice behind me.I turned around and there stood a teacher telling her he would pay for my lunch.He told me his name, Mr.Pete Walker, and said, \"If you get a chance, you should take my history class.\" I recognized his name, and told him I was in his class later that day.Mr.Walker befriended me on the.very first clay of school at a very crucial time of the day--lunch !\nHe always told us we should do more than we ever thought.he pushes us to clod all things better.He coached many sports, and sponsored many after-class activities.If we were interested in something, he would find a way to expose us to it by inviting speakers, taking us on field trips, or obtaining information for us.\nTwo years later, my junior year in school was clicking along nicely when one day I was riding my motorcycle and I was hit by a car.

One hundred years later, however, the Indians only had a very small part of the land that originally belonged to them. How did this great injustice   occur?\nAfter 1812 white settlers began to move west across North America. At first, the settlers and the Indians lived in peace. However, the number of settlers increased greatly every year, and slowly the Indians began to see the white settlers as a danger to their survival. To feed themselves, the settlers killed more and more wild animals. The Indians, who depended on these animals for food, had to struggle against starvation. The settlers also brought with them many diseases which were common in white society, but which were new for the Indians. Great numbers of Indians became sick and died. Between 1843 and 1854 the Indian population in one area of the country went down from 100,000 to 30,000.\nMore land was needed for the increasing number of white settlers. In Washington, the old respect for the rights of the Indians disappeared. The old promises to the Indians were broken; the government began to move groups of Indians from their original homelands to other poorer parts of the country. Some Indians reacted angrily and violently to this treatment. They began to attack white settlers, and the Indian war began. For 30 years, until the late 1880s, different groups of Indians fought against the injustices of the white man. They had a few famous successes, but the result of the struggle was never in doubt. There were too many white soldiers, and they were too powerful. Many Indians were killed; the survivors were moved from their homelands to different areas of the country.

And indeed,  cutting fat  to control or lose weight makes sense. Fat has nine calories per gram. Protein and carbohydrates  have just four. Moreover, the body uses fewer calories to metabolize fat than it does to metabolize other foods. Compared with protein and carbohydrates -- which break down into amino acids and simple sugars, respectively, and can be used to strengthen and energize the body ---- dietary fat is more easily converted to body fat. Therefore, it's more likely to stay on buttocks, thighs and bellies.\nBut cutting fat from your diet doesn't necessarily mean your body won't store fat. For example, between nonfat and regular cookies, there's trivial difference in calories because manufacturers make up for the loss of fat by adding sugar. Low-fat crackers, soups and dressings can also be just as high in calories as richer versions. No matter where the calories come from, overeating will still cause weight again. The calories from fat just do it a little quicker. A Wisconsin computer programmer who decided with a diet coach to eat only 40 grams of fat a day learned the lesson firsthand. He wasn't losing weight. Then he showed his food diary to his coach and revealed he'd been eating half a pound of jelly beans a day. \"They don't have any fat,\" he explains. But they had enough sugar to keep him from shedding an ounce. \nNonfat foods become add-on foods. When we add them to our diet, we actually increase the number of calories we eat per day and gain weight. That was borne out in a Pennsylvania State University study. For breakfast, Prof. Barbara Rolls gave two groups of women yogurt that contained exactly the same amount of calories. One group's yogurt label said \"high fat\"--the other, \"low fat.\" The \"low fat\" yogurt group ate significantly more calories later in the day than the other group. \"People think they've saved fat and can indulge themselves later in the day with no adverse consequences,\" says Richard Mattes, a nutrition researcher at Purdue University. \"But when they do that, they don't compensate very precisely, and they often end up overdoing it.\"", "id": "high7462.txt"}, {"answers": ["C", "D", "B", "A"], "options": [["1", "3", "4", "5"], ["Pax is the last children that Jolie has.", "Vietnamese laws allow everyone to adapt orphan.", "Pax meet the whole family with the help of Jolie.", "Pitt takes care of Shiloh when he acts in a movie."], ["Because Jolie thinks Pax doesn't know he has a family.", "Because Jolie wants to set an example to her other children.", "Because Pax is a strong boy in Jolie's mind.", "Because Pax can't meet his father when he is in America."], ["To attract readers' attention on the new issue of the magazine.", "To introduce Jolie's all family members to readers", "To praise Jolie's generous deeds of adopting children.", "To instruct readers how to adopt a child from Vietnam."]], "questions": ["According to the passage, how many children does Jolie have in all?", "Which of the following statements is TURE?", "Why does Jolie want to start a gentle relationship with her son Pax?", "What is the purpose of this passage?"], "article": "COVER STORY--Pax's New Life  \nBy Michelle Tauber and Mary Green  \nThe actress and 3-year-old Pax Thien Jolie, whom she adopted last weekfrom an orphanage in Ho Chi Minh City, left Hanoi's Noi Bai Airport in a private jet on Wednesday, bound for home--and, for Pax, a new life - in the U.S.\n    Jolie, 31, understands the challenges her new son will face as the latest addition to the world's most famous multicultural family. \"You can imagine what courage it takes to be in all new surroundings, with new people and a new language,\" she tells PEOPLE in its new issue. \"He is very strong.\" But she is committed to making his transition as smooth as possible. \"It will take him a while to realize he has a family,\" she says, \"and that his new life is permanent and that it won't keep changing.\"\n    The boy with the sweetly shy smile and the big brown eyes joins big brother Maddox, 5(adopted from Cambodia), sister Zahara, 2 (adopted from Ethiopia) and 10-month-old Shiloh, the daughter born to Jolie and Brad Pitt, 43, in May. \n    As for Dad, because Vietnamese regulations don't allow unmarried couples to co-adopt, Jolie adopted Pax as a single parent while Pitt remained inprefix = st1 /Los Angeles, where he is filmingThe Curious Case of Benjamin Button. \"He has specific days on the movie that couldn't be changed or production would run over,\" says his rep.\n    But Jolie still made sure to bring a welcoming committee: Joined by Maddox and Zahara - Shiloh has been on theButtonset every day with her father--the new mom used her first few days with Pax to begin gently bonding with him and to ask her other kids to do the same.\n   \"We are slowly beginning to build his trust and bond,\" Jolie says, \"but it will feel complete only when we are all together.\"\nFor exclusive photos - plus details on Angelina and Pax's first moments together, what Pax's life was like at the orphanage and more - pick up this week'sPEOPLE,on newsstands Friday.", "id": "high23718.txt"}, {"answers": ["D", "C", "D", "A"], "options": [["On July 22.", "On July 23.", "On July 25.", "On July 26."], ["More than 1,300.", "Exactly 2,600.", "More than 2,600.", "Less than 2,600."], ["the five-day joint military drill is held in Russia's Far East area.", "China, Russia and other member states of the SCO, held three similar anti-terrorism exercises before this", "not only the other four member states of the SCO, but also the members from America and France will send military observers", "the target for the exercise is to show two nations strong determination to beat the terrorists severely and at the same time to show their military abilities to jointly deal with various kinds of security threats internationally."], ["Peace Mission-2009.", "A Five-day Joint Military Drill.", "Mission for Peace Tarets Terrorists.", "Chinese Forces Ready for Sunday's Joint Drill."]], "questions": ["In which day will the military exercise end?", "How many soldiers in all between China and Russian will conduct joint exercise?", "The passage tells us that     .", "What can be the best title for the text?"], "article": "(Xinhua)\nChinese and Russian armed forces on Wednesday began a five-day joint military drill aimed at boosting their troops' capability in fighting against terrorist.

After the college announced last October that it would go co-educational, about half of the students protested and two filed a lawsuit, which they later dropped. \nThe students--33 men and 383 women--came to campus late last month. Both sexes are now trying to navigate the new social landscape. Mr. Phillips said \"You can't do guy stuff.

They could enjoy the friendship of their campus sisters and their playful traditions. Besides jumping into the lake, the women dance around the maypole each May and kiss the feet of the statue of Minerva, the Roman goddess of wisdom, before exams. \nMs. Alexander said, \"People told us we wouldn't notice a difference, but from the moment men arrived on campus you could notice a difference. Women are waking up early to put on makeup, and that's odd,\" she said. \nHenry Wells, a founder of Wells Fargo and a friend of Cornell's donator, Ezra Cornell established this college, when women were not considered capable of higher learning. \"Give her the opportunity,\" he wrote.\nThe news that the college would go coed created ripples far beyond campus.

When they couldn't find the note, the musicians reported that the sounds were unpleasant, while non-musicians were much less sensitive. This shows the importance of training or nurturing  the brain to like particular sound of combinations of notes, like those found in jazz or rock.\nDepending on their training, a strange chord  sound was pleasant to some musicians, but very unpleasant to others. This showed us that even the ability to hear a musical note is learnt.\nTo confirm this finding, they trained 19 non-musicians to find the notes of a random selection of western chords. Not only did the participants' ability to hear notes improve rapidly, afterward they reported that the chords they had learnt sounded more pleasant -- regardless of how the chords were played.\nThe question of why some combinations of musical notes are heard as pleasant or unpleasant has long been debated. \"We have shown in this study that for music, beauty is in the brain of the beholder \", a researcher said.", "id": "high5887.txt"}, {"answers": ["B", "C", "C", "B", "A"], "options": [["the crowd is wearing them", "you don't look good in red", "you can't afford them", "your parents disapprove"], ["obey their parents", "take the advice of their elders", "be independent", "follow the crowd"], ["will make themselves happy", "will lose friends", "sometimes do things against their better judgment", "finally become pace-setters in their own right"], ["in every school there is a \"top\" crowd that sets the pace", "it is a mistake to follow the \"top\" crowd blindly", "at one time or another you probably did something you knew to be wrong", "people who follow the \"top\" crowd are endangering their lives"], ["On Being Yourself.", "The \"Top\" Crowd.", "Follow the Leader.", "Rules for Teens."]], "questions": ["The writer disapproves of wearing red sweaters if   _  .", "The writer urges the readers to   _  .", "People who blindly follow the \"top\" crowd   _  .", "The main idea of this passage is that   _  .", "Which is the best title for this passage?"], "article": "In every school there is a \"top\" crowd that sets the pace, while the others follow their lead.

Whenever I had five minutes unoccupied, I sat down and wrote a hundred words or so. To my astonishment, at the end of the week I had a rather large manuscript  ready for revision. Later on I wrote novels by the same piecemeal  method. Though my teaching schedule had become heavier than ever, in every day there were moments which could be caught and put to use.\nThere is an important trick in this time-using principle: you must get into your work quickly.

We have to wear special clothing, a helmet and a life jacket, just in case the raft gets turned upside down or sinks after white-water rafting, we're going on a trip to see wild animals inKenya. We'll live with the local people in their villages, and eat and drink like they do, including cow's blood! Do you think I should drink it?\nSince we'll be walking every day for almost two weeks, I'll need to buy a large, strong, light backpack to carry my supplies of food and water. During the day, we'll walk across the land, following the footprints of big animals such as elephants, lions and giraffes. We'll try to get as close as possible to the animals, even though they're dangerous, so that I can take some really good photos. But don't worry about me--our Guides will have guns with them to scare the animals away if they come too close. I really want to see an elephant up close.

Now, a new study reported online on April 2nd in Current Biology shows that jackdaws--birds related to crows with eyes that appear similar to human eyes--can do the same.\n\"Jackdaws seem to recognize the eye's role in visual perception, or at the very least they are extremely sensitive to the way that human eyes are oriented ,\" said Auguste von Bayern, formerly of the University of Cambridge and now at the University of Oxford.\nWhen presented with a preferred food, hand-raised jackdaws took significantly longer to get the reward when a person was directing his eyes towards the food than when he was looking away, according to the research team led by Nathan Emery of the University of Cambridge and Queen Mary University of London. The birds hesitated only when the person was unfamiliar and thus potentially threatening.\nIn addition, the birds were able to interpret human communicative gestures, such as gaze alternation and pointing, to help them find hidden food, they found. The birds were unsuccessful in using unmoving cues, including eye gaze or head orientation.\nUnlike most birds, jackdaws' eyes have a dark pupil surrounded by a silvery white iris. The researchers said they believe jackdaws are probably sensitive to human eyes because, as in humans, eyes are an important means of communication for them. The hand-raised birds examined in the study may be even better than wild jackdaws at attending to human gaze and responding to the gestures of the people who have raised them.\nThe findings are particularly notable given that most other species investigated so far, including our closest  s the chimpanzee and \"man's best friend,\" the dog, are not particularly sensitive to eye orientation and eye gaze, von Bayern said. Rather, she continued, chimps and dogs seem to rely on other cues such as head or body orientation in determining the looking direction of others. The results suggest that birds may deserve more respect for their mental abilities. \n\"We may have understated the psychological world of birds,\" von Bayern said. \"Jackdaws, among many other birds, form pair ties for life and need to have much in common and work together with their partner, which requires an efficient way of communicating and sensitivity to their partner's viewpoint.\"", "id": "high17810.txt"}, {"answers": ["B", "C"], "options": [["the education of mothers", "the supervision of mothers on children", "whether the mother uses drugs", "the guidance of schools on mothers"], ["16-year-old Tom from a happy big family.", "17-year-old Kate supervised by her single mother.", "18-year-old Juliet living with her single father.", "19-year-old Mark cared for by his parents."]], "questions": ["The phrase \"maternal bond\" refers to_.", "According to McArdle, which is most likely to have the drug abuse problem?"], "article": "A caring mother is the most important single factor in preventing teenagers from abusing drugs and alcohol, researchers said on Friday.

The teenagers also filled in questionnaires about their relationship with their parents and grandparents, how well they were supervised   after school and whether they were allowed to meet friends at home.\n\"Both the quality of family relationships and the structure of families have significant influences on youth drug use,\" McArdle said in a statement. But he added a strong maternal bond offered the greatest protection against developing drug habits.\nThe rate of drug abuse among teenagers living with both parents and who bad a good relationship with their mother was 16.6 percent. If either factor was missing the drug abuse rate rose to 32 percent. More than 42 percent of teenagers living in one parent families who did not have a strong bond with their mother used drugs.\nDrug prevention campaigns in British schools and on television warn teenagers about the danger of drugs and alcohol but McArdle said no one is undertaking the issue of their parents' responsibility.\n(http://edu.china.com/zh _ cn/elearn/english/news/512/20020516/11254954.html)", "id": "high17840.txt"}, {"answers": ["A", "C", "C", "B", "D"], "options": [["Jazz music", "Classical music", "Rock music", "Pop music"], ["When he was less than 14 years old", "When he was in the school band", "After he became a grown-up", "His beautiful speech"], ["His great happy smile.", "His sad and slow songs.", "His wonderful jazz music", "His beautiful speech."], ["of the origin of jazz music", "of the famous jazz musician Louis Armstrong", "how Louis came to play his horn", "how people loved Louis and his horn"], ["Musician", "A Beautiful Horn", "Sweet Smiles", "The Man With the Horn"]], "questions": ["What music did Armstrong play?", "When did he learn to read music?", "What was Louis Armstrong most famous for?", "This story mainly tells us_.", "Which of the following is the best title for this story?"], "article": "The crowd cheered and cheered.

Large companies have a difficult time switching into new markets because there is a temptation to put existing assets   into the new businesses.\nAlthough Kodak predicted the unavoidable rise of digital photography, its corporate   culture was too rooted in the successes of the past for it to make the clean break necessary to fully embrace the future. They were a company stuck in time. Their history was so important to them. Now their history has become a liability.\nKodak's downfall over the last several decades was dramatic. In 1976, the company commanded 90% of the market for photographic film and 85% of the market for cameras. But the 1980s brought new competition from Japanese film company Fuji Photo, which undermined Kodak by offering lower prices for film and photo supplies. Kodak's decision not to pursue the role of official film for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics was a major miscalculation. The bid went instead to Fuji, which exploited its sponsorship to win a permanent foothold in the marketplace.", "id": "high4619.txt"}, {"answers": ["B", "B"], "options": [["four", "five", "six",

San Francisco Bay is a good example of a beautiful bay that's full of chemicals. Scientists discovered pollution in some lakes and rivers when they found fish with rotting skin. People are told not to eat too much fish because of pollution. Most American cities put their garbage in the ground. But New York and a few other cities put their garbage in the ocean. Boston Harbor is so polluted that scientists say it won't recover until the next century.

Some of the most able 18-year-olds are going to other parts of Britain, even to other countries. What is happening here is happening to Britain as a whole. Most noticeably, there is a growing trend of British students taking degrees in American universities. This year the number will break the psychological barrier of 1,000 students for the first time.\nAnd what is happening at the secondary-school level is happening to higher education. Wherever they come from, today's students have a very different perspective on education from their parents. Because of television, the Internet and their travels, these students see the world as a much smaller place than their parents once did. They are more confident in accepting the challenge of moving from one country to another, from one culture to another; in many cases they can even apply to schools over the Internet.

For this reason there is the need to focus  on cutting carbon dioxide giving off rather than monkeying   about with the land surface.\"\nAn American scientist, Robert Jackson, has shown that when native grassland areas are invaded  by trees, carbon is lost from the soil. \"We are studying why the soil carbon disappears, but one theory is that trees do a lot more of their growing above ground compared to grasses, so less carbon goes directly into the soil from trees, \" says Jackson.\nIn wet areas of the world, the gain from trees absorbing carbon dioxide above ground seems to be outweighed  by the loss of carbon from the soil below ground.

When it comes to taking selfies , knowing the following tips can directly affect the quality of your final product. .\nThe use of light is vital to improving image quality. Lights can help avoid shadows and create soft features on your face, so turn your face toward the main light. source. If you want to be creative, play with light angles by turning your body, but make sure the photo is properly exposed and your face is lit from the front or the side. Besides, avoid taking selfies against the main light source or with overhead lighting. Additionally, natural light possesses a warmth that makes you look like you're glowing.\nWhen taking selfies, angles also matter a lot. Hold the camera away from your face, and try to take photos both horizontally and vertically. If not, your face might look bigger than usual. Ideally, the universal selfie angle is 45 degrees above your head. But you should study your face at different angles because finding your best angle requires you having seen all of them.\nOne problem with selfies is that most have distracting backgrounds. You can always do more to show others your best side. Try to simplify the background by taking selfies outdoors or in spacious areas. Document yourself engaging in interesting activities-hiking with family members, visiting landmarks, or working out with friends. At least, you can make the photo appealing by getting rid of your outstretched arm or a background that's too busy.\nYou can also download some photo apps that allow you to adjust the lighting and contrast.

While this may seem a little concern, it is in fact a serious environmental problem. The shortened hibernation period could actually lead to significant decreases in the population of several species.\nSome of the first evidence of the problem came from Colorado, where researchers at the Rocky Mountain Biological Lab have been observing marmot   hibernation behavior since the 1970s. In the early days of their studies, marmots generally hibernated several weeks into the month of May. Nowadays, however, temperatures in the area have risen by 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit, and the marmots wake up about a month earlier.\nAt least the marmots are still hibernating. Several other animals have not been hibernating at all recently. Brown bears in the Spanish Cantabrian Mountains did not hibernate last year. Chipmunks   in the US and some snakes in Australia also skipped the hibernation period. The bears seem to have survived without losing many individuals. The chipmunks and snakes, however, were not so lucky. Many of the animals died of starvation during the winter.\nThe problem with animals waking up early, or skipping hibernation altogether, lies with the creatures' metabolism  . When the animals hibernate, their metabolism drops significantly. The animals' heart rate slows, and they require very little energy to live. When the animals awake in the spring, their metabolism returns to normal.\nBut while their metabolism may be as active as it was before hibernation, food sources aren't as available as they were before. A marmot may wake up when temperatures get warmer, thinking it's spring, but plants will not have got the amount of sun they need to grow. So until the plants grow, the marmots have no reliable food source.\nMany scientists believe the problem will continue to get worse. For many biologists, that's a scary prospect.

If so, you may want to play some basketball in between hitting the books. Doctors are starting to find more and more information that suggests a connection between exercise and brain development. Judy Cameron, a scientist at Oregon Health and Oregon Health and Science University, studies brain development. According to her research, it seems that exercise can make blood vessels , including those in the brain, stronger and more fully developed. Dr. Cameron claims this allows people who exercise to concentrate better. As she says, \"While we already know that exercise is good for the heart, exercise can really cause physical changes in the brain.\"\nThe effects of exercise on brain development can even be seen in babies. Babies who do activities that require a lot of movement and physical activity show greater brain development than babies who are less physically active. With babies, even a little movement can show big results. Margaret Barnes, a pediatrician , believes in the importance of exercise. She thinks that many learning disabilities that children have in elementary school or high school can be traced back to a lack of movement as babies. \"Babies need movement that stimulates their five senses. They need to establish a connection between motion and memory. In this way, as they get older, children will begin to associate physical activity with higher learning,\" says Margaret.\nOlder people can beef up their brains as well. Scientists from 11 universities studied a group of seniors ranging in age from seventy to seventy-nine. Their study showed a short-term memory increase of up to 40 percent after exercising just three hours a week. The exercise does not have to be very difficult, but it does have to increase the heart rate. Also, just like the motion for infants  , exercise for older people should involve some complexity. Learning some new skills or motions, such as with yoga or tai-chi, helps to open up memory paths in the brain that may not have been used for a long time.\nFor most people, any type of physical activity that increases the heart rate is helpful. The main goal is to increase the brain's flow of blood. And your brain can benefit from as little as three hours of exercise a week.", "id": "high20301.txt"}, {"answers": ["A", "B", "D", "C"], "options": [["in the same building", "on the top of a big roof", "close to your house", "near banks and restaurants"], ["expensive things", "small and cheap things", "things worth many dollars", "everything you need in the house"], ["Shopping centers", "Fine stores in America", "Five-and-ten-cent stores", "Supermarkets"], ["What a shopping Center is?", "Why people like supermarkets?", "Three types of places for shopping.", "Old and new stores."]], "questions": ["The shops and stores in a shopping center are  _  .", "A five-and-ten-cent store usually sells  _  .", "_  have baskets ready for people to carry the things they are going to buy.", "Which of the following can be the topic of the article?"], "article": "A shopping center is a place where many different shops and stores are collected under one roof.

The followings are some suggestions that may be helpful to you.\nThe first important thing you need to know is when to begin eating. Before dinner, the hostess usually serves guests first and herself last. So do not eat as soon as you are served but wait until the hostess has also been served and has picked up her fork as the signal to begin. But at a large dinner party where there are many guests, the hostess may ask everyone to begin eating as soon as they are served. If you want to talk while eating, your mouth should certainly not be full of food because it is considered very bad manners. But it is possible to speak with a little food in the mouth. When you have to answer a question, naturally you must wait until the food in your mouth is eaten.\nWhen a dish is passed to you with a fork in the plate, you should use it to take your food. Do not take too much at a time and make sure that the other guests can have enough food.\nAnyway, good table manners are very important and they are not so simple as we thought.

Artificial   scents are being used to lead customers by the nose. These smells help to get people inside and put them in the mood to buy.

So, let us assume that historical buildings are both attractive and important to the majority of people. What should we do then if a new building is needed?\nIn my view, new architectural styles can exist perfectly well alongside an older style. Indeed, there are many examples in my own home town of Tours where modern designs have been placed very successfully next to old buildings. As long as the building in question is pleasing and does not dominate   its surroundings too much, it often improves the attractiveness of the area.\nIt is true that there are examples of new buildings which have spoilt   the area they are in, but the same can be said of some old buildings too.

According to a study by researchers at the UT Dallas Center, the photos we select may reflect individual preferences, but they also appear to reflect more deeply rooted, unconscious cultural differences. Previous research has shown that culture can affect not only language and custom, but also how we experience the world and process information. Western cultures,for example,condition people to think of themselves as highly independent entities ( ),whereas East Asian cultures stress collectivism and interdependence.\nDr. Denise Park, co-director of the Center at UT Dallas, and former graduate student Dr. ChihMao Huang of the University of Illinois, were curious about whether these patterns of cultural influence extend to cyberspace. In a paper published in the International Journal of Psychology, they examined the profile photographs of more than 500 active Facebook users from the United States and\nEast Asia. Overall, they found that profile photos of Americans are more likely to focus on the individual's face,while the profiles of East Asians tend to less emphasize the face and include more background features. Americans also show greater smile intensity compared to East Asian Facebook users.\nThe findings show marked cultural differences in the focus of attention among East Asian and American Facebook users. Moreover, they echo previous research on cultural influences on visual perception ,attention, and reasoning in the offline world.\n\"We believe these findings relate to a cultural bias to be more individualistic and independent in the US and more communal and interdependent in Asia,,,said Park.\nThe research also found that cultural influences over our self-presentation online can shift over time and from place to place. In one of the study samples, Americans studying in Japan and Japanese studying in the US both showed a tendency to adjust their profile photos to the general preferences of their host country.\n\" Facebook constitutes an extended social context in which personal profiles mirror various individual characteristics,private thoughts,and social behaviors,\" noted Huang. \" As such,the study presents a new approach to investigate cognition and behaviors across cultures by using Facebook as a data collection platform. \"", "id": "high23070.txt"}, {"answers": ["A", "B", "B", "B", "D"], "options": [["Amy was a tiresome girl", "the author's life changed a lot", "Amy was a black girl", "Amy was from a special family"], ["Because he felt pity for her.", "Because Amy helped him a lot.", "Because his school driver told him to.", "Because he was afraid that he wouldn't fit in."], ["whatever others do can change your life", "nobody can make a difference to others", "everyone can make a difference to himself", "once you dare to do, you can change a person's life"], ["Follow what others do.", "Give thanks to others.", "Stand up for what you believe in.", "Tell people not to laugh at others."], ["Because everybody will make fun of me", "Amy had many physical differences", "Amy will feel ashamed and lonely", "The other kids always made fun of her"]], "questions": ["From the story we know   _  .", "Why did the writer change his attitude towards Amy?", "The story implies that   _  .", "The lesson we can learn from the passage is \"  _  \".", "Why did Lauren warned me \"Don't talk to Amy\"?"], "article": "On the first day of the sixth grade, I waited at the bus stop for the school bus.

For some troubled students, activities can be their motivation to stay in school. \"Activities such as sports may be the only thing keeping certain students in school,\" says Duace Wood, a teacher at Mohonasen High School in Rotterdam, N.Y. Getting involved in after-class activities keeps troublesome students in class. Even if they don't do as well as their classmates, they are still learning. The more time they spend at school, the less time they have to even think about starting trouble. Teams also provide support and role models, and they help build the confidence that students need to succeed.

Previous work has shown that when children reach puberty  , there is an increase in connections between nerves in the brain. This occurs particularly in the area involved in decision-making and awareness of other people's feelings, called the \"mentalising network\".\nNow Sarah-Jayne Blakemore, a cognitive neuroscientist from the University College London, UK, has used Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging  to scan the brains of 19 adolescents (aged 11 to 17) and 11 adults (aged 21 to 37) while they were asked questions relating to decision-making. Questions such as: \"You're going to the cinema, where do you look for film times?\"\nBlakemore found that unlike adults, teenagers rely on the rear part of the mentalising network to make their decisions, an area of the brain called the superior temporal sulcus. The superior temporal sulcus is involved in processing very basic behavioral actions while the front part, called prefrontal cortex, is involved in more complex functions such as processing how decisions affect others. The prefrontal cortex makes adults more able to understand the consequences of their actions.\nIn a separate experiment, Blakemore asked 112 participants (aged from 8 to 37) questions and timed how long it took them to respond. Questions such as: \"How would your friend feel if she wasn't invited to your party?\" She found that the response time got shorter as the participants got older, suggesting that the older people found it easier to put themselves in other people's shoes.\n\"Teenagers' brains are a work in progress and profoundly different from adults' brains.

Professor Paul Frommer combined the languages spoken among Indians, Africans and mid-Asians and worked with James Caneron for four years to create the Na'vi language based on the original 30 words that the director had already come up with.\nAccording to Professor Frommer, the most important characteristic of the Na'vi language is that it could be pronounced. \"This is an alien language but obviously it has to be spoken by human actors and actresses,\" Professor Frommer told the BBC, \"it has to sound natural and it should make human beings comfortable when using it.\"\nThe language has a vocabulary of around 1000 words but Professor Formmer hopes to enlarge the vocabulary in possible follow-ups to the film and in video games. The professor hopes that one day his creation will be as successful as the Klingon alien language from the \"Star Trek\"films. \"There's a translation of Hamlet into Klingon and it has received great popularity among the audiences,\" says Professor Frommer,\"if anything like this happens to the Na'vi language, I'd be very happy.\"", "id": "high15443.txt"}, {"answers": ["B", "B", "C"], "options": [["To describe the beauty of Pacaya.", "To attract guided tours to Pacaya.", "To introduce the best time to visit Pacaya.", "To explain the power of nature at Pacaya."], ["where people can enjoy cultural festivals", "where the challenging Pacaya tours start", "that gives a close-up view of Pacaya", "that is famous for its tour companies"], ["get down the mountain in time when night falls", "avoid the smell from the upwind direction of the cone", "enjoy the fantastic eruption against the darkening sky", "appreciate the scenery of the 2,560-metre-high mountain"]], "questions": ["What is the main purpose of this passage?", "Antigua is a city   _  .", "Many tours are timed for people to   _  ."], "article": "Seeing a volcano erupt is a wonderful experience, and you can really feel the heat by climbing to the top of Pacaya for a close-up view.

Unfortunately, neither side could convince the other. The sentence is to be attached at the end of the letter. There is no doubt that the reference answer C is correct.

But being a teacher, it's very important and necessary to make it clear to students which answer is correct, which is more appropriate, and which is the best one. Regrettably, Multiple - choice test, which is a bit old - fashioned in western countries, seems to be quite popular and covers a rather high percentage in all sorts of English tests in China, especially in NMET.\n    Personally speaking, I don't think multiple - choice test form making up more than 75 percent of the total scores in college entrance examination is a very good and effective testing method. Instead, more subjective testing forms depending on one's own thinking and his ability to use the language like key words falling, question answering, paragraph or passage summarizing, English - Chinese or Chinese - English inter - translation, etc. should be applied to English proficiency tests. Through the test forms mentioned above, students' ability to use the language will be better developed. Consequently, more advanced and outstanding English learners could be picked out. In fact, a test paper focusing on multiple - choice test influences, in a sense, students to form their own language thinking, which hinders the development of their language ability as well.

But explaining a clear connection to weather is harder.\n\"Our research confirms the observed connection between solar change and regional winter climate,\" lead author Sarah Ineson of the UK Met Office told the reporters in an email. The study was published in the magazine Nature Geoscience on Monday.\nThe researchers found that the reducing of ultraviolet(UV,) radiation from the sun can affect high-altitude wind patterns in the Northern Hemisphere , causing cold winters.\n\"While UV levels won't tell us what the day-to-day weather will do, they show us the bright future of improved forecasts for winter conditions for months and even years ahead.

This causes a redistribution  of heat in the atmosphere, making easterly winds that bring freezing weather and snowstorms to northern Europe and the United States and milder weather to Canada and the Mediterranean.\nWhen solar UV radiation is stronger, the opposite occurs.\nMore study was needed, though.

Yesterday, Pantene even released a video about how often women apologize in everyday situations.\nApologizing unnecessarily puts women in a subservient  position and makes people lose respect for them, says executive coach and radio host Bonnie Marcus. Sylvia Ann Hewlett, founder of the Manhattan-based think tank, Center for Talent Innovation and author of Executive Presence: The Missing Link Between Talent and Success, says using \"sorry\" frequently undermines our gravitas and makes them appear unfit for leadership.\nIt's not like women don't know it's a bad habit. So, why do they do it?\nBusiness consultant Kathryn D. Cramer, author of Lead Positive: What Highly Effective Leaders See, Say, and Do, says women are socialized from an early age to focus on relationships and nurturing. Any sign of strength can be off-putting, so they're conditioned to soften communication that can be construed as assertive or aggressive. Apologizing before speaking--or in any situation where women must show strength or where there is potential for conflict--is one way of doing _ .\nShe adds that workplace culture contributes to its use, too. In many cases, strong women need to find ways to temper  their personalities or risk being called \"rude,\" \"abrasive,\" or even risk their jobs if they don't find ways to soften others' perception, she says. But saying \"sorry\" too often can be more career-killing than being disliked. So, it's time to purge the word unless you really have something to be sorry about.\nMarcus suggests keeping a log  of when you \"sorry,\" what the situation was, and how you felt. Sometimes, \"sorry\" is just a verbal tic , but some usage patterns may indicate a situation or person who makes you feel insecure, she says. Being aware of those triggers and how they influence your language can help you be more vigilant in \"changing your communication so you're coming from a position of strength and equality,\" she says.\nTrusted friends can help you break the habit by quietly letting you know when you're using \"sorry\" inappropriately, Cramer says. Knowing that you're under another watchful eye is also going to make you more aware of your speech, she says.\nSometimes, saying \"sorry\" is easier than thinking about the word you really want to say, or becomes a way of softening your words or opinion before they're even out of your mouth, Cramer says. If either is the case, be more careful to choose the word or phrase you really mean to say. \"Start your statement with, 'Let me say this...' or some other word or phrase that reflects your meaning better than saying 'sorry,'\" she says.\nSometimes, instead of saying \"sorry,\" it's best to not say anything at all.

Another music great, Smokey Robinson, has described Chuck Berry as \"the inspiration for all of today's rock 'n' roll guitarists.\" And, Anthony Kiedis calls him \"a musical scientist who discovered a cure for the blues.\"\n   On stage, he became known for his wild performances, and his \"duck walk\" that many musicians copied. But his songwriting skills -- some call him a rock and roll poet -- and his guitar work really set him apart. Early in his career he played mostly blues for black audiences in clubs in St. Louis, Missouri. But the most popular music in the area was country. So this musical scientist mixed country and blues. \n   Chuck Berry was born on October 18th, 1926, in St. Louis, where he still lives. His mother, Martha, was a high school principal. He was born the fourth of six children. He started singing in church when he was six years old. His interest in music stuck with him. \n    A lot of Chuck Berry's material is about teenage life, especially school. Chuck Berry and two friends were arrested after they used a gun to steal a car . He was released from prison four years later. But that would not be the last of his legal problems over the years.\nFilmmaker Taylor Hackford made a documentary called \"Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll,\" named for a Chuck Berry song. It centered on the making of a concert to honor the musician on his sixtieth birthday in 1986. More than seventy-five artists and bands have done their own versions of Chuck Berry songs. Many have done several, including the Rolling Stones, Elvis Presley, Conway Twitty and Bruce Springsteen.\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio, included Chuck Berry in its first year of honors in 1986. The Hall of Fame had this to say: \"While no individual can be said to have invented rock and roll, Chuck Berry comes the closest of any single figure to being the one who put all the essential pieces together.\"", "id": "high17269.txt"}, {"answers": ["D", "C", "B", "C"], "options": [["Because she discovered the avermectin, a drug cure for malaria", "Because she contributed to the traditional Chinese medicine", "Because she discovered the artemisinin which shows effectiveness against other parasitic diseases", "Because she has saved millions of lives for the discovery of artemisinin."], ["Chinese science awards are mainly presented to individual scientists, instead of projects", "Chinese believes that the advancement of science comes from individuals' creative minds", "Western awards tend to honor individual scientists who are the first to come up with a new idea or method", "Western awards are presented to both individual scientists and projects"], ["85", "81", "46", "39"], ["Why Tu Youyou could be awarded the 2015 Nobel prize", "Why Tu received the \"America's Nobel Prize\".", "Tu Youyou won the 2015 Nobel Prize for the discovery of artemisinin", "The difference in prize-awarding practices between China and the West"]], "questions": ["Why Tu Youyou could be awarded the Nobel Prize for ?", "What is the difference in prize-awarding practices between China and the West?", "How old was Tu Youyou when she was awarded the \"America's Nobel Prize\".", "What is the best title of the passage?"], "article": "Tu Youyou together with William Campbell and Satoshi Omura won the 2015 Nobel Prize for their work against parasitic diseases.

The Chinese scientist Tu Youyou, an 85-year-old female scientist, was awarded the other half of the prize for the discovery of artemisinin , a drug cure for malaria  that has saved millions of lives all over the world, especially in the developing world.\nWhen the news broke that Tu won the Nobel Prize, there were cheers as well as doubts. It also has highlighted differences in prize-awarding practices between China and the West. Some said the achievement was the result of collective efforts by lots of Chinese scientists, so it was unfair to award the prize only to Tu. Indeed, Chinese science awards are mainly presented to projects, instead of individual scientists. But Western awards tend to honor individual scientists who are the first to come up with a new idea or method. Li Zhenzhen, a researcher of the China Academy of Sciences said that the West believes that the advancement of science comes from individuals' creative minds.\nIn 1969, Tu started to hold a government project aimed at eliminating malaria. Tu and her teammates experimented with 380 extracts in 2,000 candidate recipes before they finally succeeded in getting the pure substance qinghaosu, later known as artemisinin. In 2011, Tu was awarded the Lasker Debakey Clinical Medical Research Award, commonly referred to as \"America's Nobel Prize\".

Some, such as the Let Me Play sessions offered by Nike, are free and provide a few hours of instruction by professional athletes.

That's a big problem. Study after study suggests that handwriting is important for brain development -- helping kids get fine motor skills and learn to express and create ideas. Yet the time devoted to teaching penmanship in most schools has shrunk to just one hour a week. Is it time to give up handwriting? Have a look at the link between the brain and penmanship, and you may get the answer.\nA test among students in grades 2, 4 and 6 found that they not only wrote faster by hand than by keyboard, but also created more ideas when composing essays with handwriting. And other research shows that the finger movements required to write by hand activate brain areas involved with thought, language, and short-term memory.\nA recent Indiana University study had one group of children practice writing letters by hand while a second group just looked at those letters. Then, both groups of kids entered a functional MRI   that scanned their brains as the researchers showed them the same letters. Researchers found that the brain activity in the first group was far more advanced and \"adult-like\".\nHandwriting also affects other people's way they think of adults and children. Several studies have shown that the same average essay will score much higher if written with good penmanship and much lower if written out in poor handwriting. These studies have also found that people judge the quality of a person's ideas based on his or her handwriting. And the consequences are real: On standardized tests with handwritten sections, like the SAT, all essay that is considered hard to recognize gets a big zero.\nStudies show that this isn't only an English-language phenomenon. Chinese and Japanese youths are suffering from \"character amnesia\". They can't remember how to write characters, thanks to computers and text messaging.

One would certainly think otherwise; selecting and putting up our trees have always been filled with risk.\nFor example, one afternoon dangerously close to Christmas Eve _ , a glorious tree that was so full and tall that we could hardly get it into the house. Once we did, my father immediately realized that we would have to hire a carpenter to build a stand for it.\nAnother December, perhaps the very next one, we bought a tree earlier than we ever had before. We were happy with its shape and delighted that its size was manageable. We easily placed it in a stand, decorated it from top to bottom, and then self-satisfiedly sat back by the fire in its soft light.\nTwo or three days passed and the truth could not be hidden; we had bought a tree cut so long ago that its needles were coming off. There was nothing to do but undecorated it, take it down, and begin tree shopping again.\nOur most recent Christmas tree offered still another difficult task. When we brought it home, once again it seemed larger than it was in the great outdoors. To complicate matters, we had bought a new stand, one whose nuts and bolts worked more mysteriously than those of our old stands. I persuaded two young neighbors to stop playing basketball and to help us get the tree into the house and set it correctly in the stand. Unfortunately, no one noticed the mud on our helpers' shoes, so only after removing several reddish brown sports from the carpet were we able to discuss the question of where the lights and ornaments were stored. Perhaps those who cut their own trees have tales more painful than these.

Before that, she wrote several novels and short stories which sold moderately well in the early 1900s. Then a publisher asked Ms. Post to write a book on suggested etiquette. Many people during this time had  _ through the boom in the American economy just after World War I, but these people were not raised in \"polite society\"; therefore, they did not necessarily have the proper manners. Ms. Post's book was planned to help these new upper-middle class people pass smoothly into their new social circle. She wrote the book, and it became a great success. In fact, it continued to sell well for the next 20 years. Ms. Post began writing a weekly advice column for newspapers, and the column was published in papers across the country. She even had her own radio show for several years. Ms. Post died in 1960, but her book on etiquette is still published with occasional updates under the title \"The Emily Post Book of Etiquette\". Americans continue to turn to this book for advice on the proper behaviour in a variety of social situations.\nOne area in which people in the United States can count on words of wisdom from Ms. Post is in giving gifts. Everyone has to give gifts at some time or another, and Ms. Post explains just what to do in each situation. Whether the occasion is a birthday party for a friend,  , or coworker, there are some basic rules the gift-giver and the receiver should follow.\nGiving money is a common concern among gift-givers. \"When is it proper? When is it rude? Some people see a gift of money as a sign of a gift-giver who is too lazy to go out and find a proper gift. However, this is not always the case. Sometimes money is more appreciated than a gift that the receiver does not need or cannot use. For example, elderly people who must live on a limited income may find a small gift of money as a wonderful present. For those who are uncomfortable giving cash, gift certificates to popular stores may serve as an equally acceptable gift.\nGiving flowers can be a wonderful gift for both men and women. For occasions such as funerals and dinner parties, flowers are often required. When attending a dinner party, a host or hostess may not have the time to run off and find a vase for fresh-cut flowers brought by a thoughtful guest. Bringing the flowers in a prepared vase can save the host or hostess the trouble.

For example, you see a car coming straight towards you. Fear warns you, you jump out of the way, and all is well.\nIn some cases, however, you decide that there is nothing that you can do to avoid the danger. For example, you can't prevent an aeroplane crashing onto your house.

The usually colorful corals are a ghostly white. Most of the fish, crabs, and other animals have disappeared. The reef is sick and dying.\nCoral reefs are often called \"the rainforests of the sea\" because of their abundance of life forms. A great diversity of animals finds food and shelter in every crack and crevice.\nToday's reefs are about 10,000 years old. Found in sunny, shallow water in warm seas all over the world, reefs are made up of the hard shells of millions of corals. As corals live and die, they create a giant, rocky honeycomb. Only a thin top layer is living coral.\nA reef grows only about as fast as your fingernails--three-quarters of an inch a year. But coral reefs are huge, and in time a healthy reef can be thousands of miles long.\nMillions of people around the world rely on reef fish and other animals for food. And reefs provide protection from storms at sea. Without thousands of miles of reefs surrounding coastal areas, many beaches and even whole islands could be destroyed by the pounding of powerful ocean waves.\n\"Let's say a grazing animal like the parrot fish is overfished,\" Michele explains. \"Without them, the kind of algae   that the fish feed on could grow like weeds and take over the reef. The competition for space and sunlight could then starve the coral.\"\nNearly 27 percent of the world's coral reefs have been lost or damaged. But there is hope. Many reefs around the world--including the Great Barrier Reef in Australia and the reefs off the Florida Keys in the United States--are now protected areas where scientists study how to keep reefs healthy. They determine how many and which kinds of fish can be taken for food without hurting the reef's delicate balance.\nThere is hope, too, that people will learn to be good partners to the reefs. \"We want our film to inspire people to help coral reefs,\" says Michele. \"For me, even though I may not go back to the South Pacific, just knowing the reefs are there and thriving brings a sense of contentment   to my spirit.\"", "id": "high309.txt"}, {"answers": ["A", "A", "C"], "options": [["how to express ourselves when using e-mail", "computers, so much a part of our everyday lives", "the Internet, a much better servant than a master", "paying close attention to grammar and spelling when dealing with a formal e-mail"], ["yelling", "careful", "unprofessional", "childish"], ["As time goes by, many people prefer to use traditional regular mail again.", "It's fun to meet a stranger that you have spoken to online.", "If you want to apply for a job, you can't use a funny e-mail address when writing e-mails.", "Grammar and spelling are not important when you write e-mails."]], "questions": ["The text is mainly about  _  .", "If you use all capital letters, it looks like you are  _  .", "Which of the following statements would the writer agree to?"], "article": "Computers.Love them or hate them, it is impossible to escape from them in the modern age.They are so much a part of our everyday lives--from instant messaging to e-mails.With many people preferring to use e-mail rather than traditional regular mail, it has become very important to be aware of how we express ourselves when using e-mail.The requirement of etiquette is obviously needed.\n         Grammar and spelling\n         Firstly, if you are dealing with a formal e-mail, pay close attention to grammar and spelling.Don't forget to run your spell-check (program) at the end of the document, but don't treat it as the final word.Carefully re-read it yourself, as sometimes even spell and grammar checking programs come up with some strange explanations.Remember, your first e-mail to a potential employer or college could be your last -- you won't want to spoil your first impression by making basic errors.\n         E-mail addresses\n         Also, for official e-mails, carefully consider your existing e-mail address.A funny e-mail address (such as pinkfluffycutiepie@...com) may be fine for using with your friends, but what impression do you think this address might give to an employer or college admissions officer?

February 7 marked the 200th anniversary of his birthday. Yet for many, his language is old-fashioned and his stories often improbable. So why do so many people know and read Dickens today?\nOne reason is the British government's insistence that every child studies a Dickens novel at school. Alongside William Shakespeare, Dickens is on every English literature school reading list.\nHis stories, though often long by today's standards, are great moral tales. They are filled with colorful characters.\nEarlier this month, a ceremony was held in Portsmouth, where Dickens was born. Prince Charles said at the ceremony, \"Dickens used his creative genius to campaign passionately for social justice... His characterization   is as fresh today as on the day it was written.\"\nHis books stand out from many other writers because of his insight into human nature. Dickens, like Shakespeare, tells us truths about human behavior. They are as true in the 21st century as they were to his readers in the 19th century.\nReaders have returned to Dickens' books again and again over the years to see what he has to say about their own times.\nNo surprise then that it was Dickens whom Britons turned to during the economic crisis in the last couple of years. Dickens helped them make sense of a world that was rapidly falling apart. The BBC adapted one of his less well-known novels, Little Dorrit, into a popular television drama that introduced many Brits to the novel for the first time. A dark story about greed and money, it was the perfect illustration of bad times.\nAs long as Dickens's novels have something to say to modern audiences, it seems likely that he will remain one of Britain's best-loved writers.", "id": "high9864.txt"}, {"answers": ["A", "B", "B", "C"], "options": [["dull and changeless", "rich and various", "popular and delicious", "disagreeable and unpleasant"], ["cuisines of other countries play a more important role in America", "American cuisine has become increasingly lacking in variety", "American cuisine tends to vary because of immigration", "American cuisine is being changed by foreign cuisines"], ["were cooked with new materials after the Civil War", "are gaining popularity in the south of America", "were more popular over ten years ago", "are seldom served in restaurants"], ["Concerned and cautious.", "Hopeless and doubtful.", "Positive and supportive.", "Critical and disapproving."]], "questions": ["According to the passage,American cuisine impresses people as being   _  .", "It can be seen that the writer feels regretful that   _  .", "From the passage,we know that grits and gravy   _  .", "What's the writer's attitude towards the renewal of Low Country cuisine in America?"], "article": "Culture and Cuisine\nThe United States is known for jazz and blue jeans.But travel to Paris and ask your average French citizen about American cuisine   and he's likely to answer,\" McDonalds.\" Ask the same thing of any American citizen on any American street and I'm afraid you'd get the same answer,or something close to it.\nHamburgers and hotdogs and fries are all fine,but with American malls and other outlets standardizing everything from clothing to food,the sad truth is that American cuisine is becoming more homogeneous--all the same--no matter where you live.True,many Americans are eating more varied foods these days,but these are largely the cuisines of immigrant groups,and they are quite likely to be affected by homogenization of American cuisine.\nSo what exactly is American cuisine?

An estimated 6 million televisions and computers are stocked in California homes, and an additional 6,000 to 7,000 computers become outdated every day. The machines contain high levels of lead   and other dangerous substances, and are already banned from California landfills.\nA bill by Senator   Byron Sher would require consumers to pay a recycling fee of up to $30 on every new machine containing a cathode ray tube. Used in almost all video monitors and televisions, those devices contain four to eight pounds of lead each. The fees would go toward setting up recycling programs, providing grants to non-profit agencies that reuse the tubes and rewarding manufacturers that encourage recycling.\nA separate bill by Los Angeles-area Senator Gloria Romero would require high-tech manufacturers to develop programs to recycle so-called e-waste. If passed, the measures would put California at the forefront of national efforts to manage the refuse of the electronic age.\nBut high-tech groups, including the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group and the American Electronics Association, oppose the measures, arguing that fees of up to $30 will drive consumers to online, out-of-state shops.\n\"What really needs to occur is consumer education. Most consumers are unaware they're not supposed to throw computers in the dust bin,\" said Roxanne Gould, vice president of government relations for the electronics association.\nComputer recycling should be a local effort and part of residential waste collection programs, she added. Recycling electronic waste is a dangerous and specialized matter, and environmentalists maintain the state must support recycling efforts and ensure that the job isn't contracted to junk dealers who send the poisonous parts overseas.\n\"The graveyard of the high-tech revolution is ending up in rural China,\" said Ted Smith, director of the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition.

A lot of people say that Balinese culture is unique and that the people of Bali have always been content with the \"now\". If you ask a Balinese person what heaven is like, the probable answer will be \"just like Bali\". This only goes to show that most Balinese people are happy to be where they are and never worry.\nOne factor that contributes to this laidback lifestyle is the culture of close family ties in Bali. In the Balinese culture, support is always available. Balinese extended families are so tightly linked that all members usually live in the same block.\nBalinese culture is based on a form of this religion, which is called \"Hindu Darma\". This religion reached the island during the eleventh century. Most of the family customs and traditions as well as community lifestyles of the Balinese people are influenced by this. The religious influence even expands widely into the arts, which makes Bali distinct from the rest of Indonesia.\nIn spite of the fact that tourists flood to the island every year, Balinese people have managed to _ their culture. Almost every native of Bali is an artist in some form or another. Parents and villagers have passed on their skills to their children, who all seem to have inclinations   either to music, dance, painting, or decoration.\nAnother remarkable mark of the Balinese culture is the senses of ceremonies known as the Manusa Yadnya. This marks the different stages of Balinese life.

It seems that there is no set of personal qualities that all leaders have in common; or rather, any person may be recognized as a leader if the person has qualities that meet the needs of that particular group.\nResearch suggests that there are typically two different leadership roles that are held by different individuals. Instrumental leadership is leadership that emphasizes the completion of tasks by a social group. Group members look to instrumental leaders to \"get things done\". Expressive leadership, on the other hand, is leadership that emphasizes the collective well-beings  of a social group's members. Expressive leaders are less concerned with the overall goals of the group than with providing emotional support to group members and attempting to minimize tension and conflict among them.\nInstrumental leaders are likely to have a rather secondary relationship to other group members. They give others and may discipline group members who inhibit  attainment of the group's goals. Expressive leaders develop a more personal or primary relationship to others in the group. They offer sympathy when someone experiences difficulties and try to solve problems that threaten to divide the group. As the difference between these two roles suggests, expressive leaders generally receive more personal affection from group members; instrumental leaders, if they are successful in promoting group goals, may enjoy a more distant respect.", "id": "high20651.txt"}, {"answers": ["D", "D", "D"], "options": [["Because the IOC didn't agree to it.", "Because it was still under discussion.", "Because some people were against the idea.", "Because World War I broke out in 1914."], ["the weather destroyed the first Winter Olympics", "people from 16 countries watched the first Winter Olympics", "Charles Jewtraw won the most medals in the first Winter Olympics", "Finland got at least 3 gold medals in speed skating in the first Winter Olympics"], ["The development of the Olympics", "The importance of weather in the Olympics", "The story of the first Winter Olympic Games", "How did the Winter Olympics come into being?"]], "questions": ["Why was the first Winter Olympic Games not held in 1916?", "We can know from the passage that_.", "What's the best title for the passage?"], "article": "As early as 1894, the newly-formed International Olympic Committee (IOC) considered ice skating as a possibility for the first modern Olympic Games which would be held in 1896.\nIn 1911, a member of the IOC suggested that winter sports should be staged as part of the 1912 Olympics in Helsinki. Some were against the idea. At last, the IOC decided to hold Winter Olympic Games in 1916. However, World War I broke out in 1914. After 1920, the national governing bodies for winter sports in several countries began talking about the possibility of a separate Winter Olympics.\nThe town of Chamonix, in the French Alps, planned to hold a winter sports festival in 1924, at the same time Paris was to host the Olympics. The Marquis de Polignac, a member of the IOC, suggested that the festival be formally recognized as the Winter Olympic Games. The IOC didn't go that far, but did agree that Chamonix could call its festival an \"Olympic winter carnival\".\nThe festival drew 258 athletes from 16 countries to compete in bobsledding , figure skating, hockey, Nordic skiing and speed skating. Charles Jewtraw from the United States won the first gold medal, in the 500-meter speed skating, but the festival's hero was Claus Thunberg from Finland. He won five medals, three of which were gold, in speed skating.\nWeather has often been a major story at the Winter Olympics, and so it was at Chamonix. The festival opened with rain and unseasonably warm temperature that turned snow and ice to mud. Then temperature dropped as far as 25 below zero and the mud became ice.\nDespite  the weather, more than 10,000 people showed up.

Silence may be viewed by some cultural groups as extremely uncomfortable; therefore attempts may be made to fill every gap with conversation. Persons in other cultural groups value silence and view it as necessary for understanding a person's needs. &\nMany Native Americans value silence and feel it is a basic part of communicating among people, just as some traditional Chinese and Thai persons do. Therefore, when a person from one of these cultures is speaking and suddenly stops, what maybe implied  is that the person wants the listener to consider what has been said before continuing.

For example, Russian, French, and Spanish persons may use silence to show agreement between parties about the topic udner discussion. However, Mexicans may use silence when instructions are given by a person in authority rather than be rude to that person by arguing with him or her. In still another use, persons in Asian cultures may view silence as a sign of respect, particularly to an elder or a person in authority.\nNurses and other care-geivers need to be aware of the possible meanings of silence when they come across the personal anxiety their patients may be expericencing.

He couldn't borrow it from the library and the only copy he could find was in a certain bookshop. Every afternoon, therefore, he would go along to the shop and read a little of the book at a time. One day, however, he was disappointed to find the book missing from his usual place. He was about to leave, when he noticed the owner of the shop beckoning to him. Expecting to be told off, he went towards him. To his surprise, the owner pointed to the book which was put away in a comer. \"I put it there so that nobody would try to buy it !\" He said, and left the delighted student continuing his reading.", "id": "high17712.txt"}, {"answers": ["B", "C", "C"], "options": [["a strange man", "how roller skating began", "an unusual party", "how people enjoyed themselves in the 18th century"], ["often gave others surprises", "was a gifted musician", "was full of imagination", "invented the roller skates"], ["test his invention", "arrive at the party sooner", "impress the party guests", "show his skill in walking on wheels"]], "questions": ["The text is mainly about  _  .", "People thought Merlin was a dreamer because he  _  .", "Merlin put wheels under his shoes in order to  _  ."], "article": "Today, roller skating is easy and fun.

The food is delicious and the service is fine. You decide to leave a big fat tip. Why? The answer may not be as simple as you think.\nTipping, psychologists have found, is not just about service. Instead, studies have shown that tipping can be affected by psychological reactions to a series of different factors from the waiter's choice of words, to how they carry themselves while taking orders, to the bill's total. Even how much waiters remind customers of themselves can determine how much change they pocket by the end of the night.\n\"Studies before have shown that mimicry   brings into positive feelings for the mimicker,\" wrote Rick van Baaren, a social psychology professor. \"These studies show that people who are being mimicked become more generous toward the person who mimics them.\"\nSo Rick van Baaren divided 59 waiters into two groups. He requested that half serve with a phrase such as, \"Coming up!\" Those in the other half were instructed to repeat the orders and preferences back to the customers. Rick van Baaren then compared their take-home. The results were clear -- it pays to mimic your customer. The copycat  waiters earned almost double the amount of tips to the other group.\nLeonard Green and Joel Myerson, psychologists at Washington University in St. Louis, found the generosity of a tipper may be limited by his bill. After research on the 1,000 tips left for waiters, cabdrivers, hair stylists, they found tip percentages in these three areas dropped as customers' bills went up. In fact, tip percentages appear to plateau   when bills topped $100 and a bill for $200 made the worker gain no bigger percentage tip than a bill for $100.\n\"That's also a point of tipping,\" Green says. \"You have to give a little extra to the cab driver for being there to pick you up and something to the waiter for being there to serve you.

If you don't use the booties, be sure to wipe your dog's paw pads with room temperature water after taking it outside.\n Other tips\nWhen you bathe your dog, dry him completely before taking him out in the cold weather for a walk or exercise. It is especially important to keep your dog well groomed   during the winter months to protect him from the elements.\n If your dog frequently participates in outdoor activities during the colder months, increase his food intake, especially protein, to help keep his coat grow thick and healthy. Dogs that are not as active during the winter months may need to have their food consumption reduced.\n The amount of time you spend outside with your dog will depend on his size, breed type and age. Remember that ill or elderly dogs are more sensitive to cold weather. Dogs whom cold weather agrees with can spend hours outside without getting cold but some of the smaller and younger dogs' exercise sessions should be kept shorter. Dogs should not be left outside unattended.\n Another activity to consider is doggie daycare, which is an excellent alternative during cold weather months. It's a great place for your dog to get plenty of physical and mental stimulation while being with other dogs.\n Banfield Pet Hospital", "id": "high17627.txt"}, {"answers": ["A", "D", "A"], "options": [["China Film Archive", "China National Film Museum", "China Film Museum", "International Cinema"], ["Oct.21", "Oct.23", "Oct.25", "Oct. 29"], ["Newspaper", "Magazine", "Textbook", "Science fiction"]], "questions": ["If you are free on Oct.29, which venue would you like to visit?", "On which day can you see the film whose theme is about adventure ?", "Where can you find the passage most likely?"], "article": "Le Havre (2011)\nTime: Oct.21, 23-25\nVenue: China National Film Museum\nPrice: 40 yuan\nLe Havre is a comedy-drama.

They use all of their senses to learn about the sights,sounds,tastes, and smells in their environments. They learn how to communicate with their parents, grandparents,\nfriends, and other people important to their world. When they enter school, children learn basic academic subjects such as reading, writing, and mathematics, They also continue to learn a great deal outside the classroom. They learn which behaviors are likely to be rewarded and which are likely to be punished. They learn social skills for communicating with other children. After they finish school, people must learn to deal with the many major changes that affect their lives, such as getting married, raising children, and finding and keeping a job.\nBecause learning continues throughout our lives and affects almost everything we do, the study of learning is important in many different fields. Teachers need to understand the best ways to educate children. Psychologists, social workers, criminologists, and other human-service workers need to understand how certain experiences change people's behaviors. Employers, politicians, and advertisers make use of the principles of learning to affect the behavior of workers, voters, and consumers.\nLearning is closely related to memory, which is the storage of information in the brain.

Kevin was standing on the grass away from the plate, where another youngster was warming up for the next game. Swinging his bat back and forth, and giving it all the power an elementary school kid could give, the boy brought the bat back hard and hit Kevin in the chest.

For those in the photo-taking camp, motivations extended beyond their inability to comprehend their own handwriting. Some took pictures of notes because they knew their phone was a safe place to store material. They might lose paper, they reasoned, but they wouldn't lose their phones. Some took photos because they wanted to record exactly the manner in which I had noted information on the board. Others told me that during class they liked to be able to listen to the discussion attentively.\nYet the use of cameras as note takers, though it may be convenient, does raise significant questions for the classroom. Is a picture an effective replacement for the process of note-taking?\nInstructors encourage students to take notes because the act of doing so is more than merely recording necessary information--it helps prepare the way for understanding. Encouraging students to take notes may be an old-fashioned instructional method, but just because a method has a long history doesn't mean it's out of date. Writing things down engages a student's brain in listening, visual, and kinesthetic learning--a view supported by a longstanding research. The act of writing down information enables a person to begin committing it to memory, and to process and combine it, establishing the building blocks of learning new concepts.\nTaking a picture does indeed record the information, but it deletes some of the necessary mental engagement that taking notes employs. So can the two be equally effective?\nI'm not sure how to measure the effectiveness of either method. For now, I allow students to take notes however they see fit--handwritten or photographed--because I figure that some notes, no matter the method of note-taking, are better than none.", "id": "high8060.txt"}, {"answers": ["D", "D", "B"], "options": [["They are independent enough.", "Home rules don't take full effect.", "They have strong responsibility.", "They behave like children."], ["Having a negotiation with parents.", "Having cold war with parents.", "Talking with their best friends.", "Moving out to live with friends."], ["The relationship between commuting students and classmates", "The advantages and disadvantages of commuting students.", "The problems between commuting students and their parents.", "The college life of Commuting students involved in."]], "questions": ["Why is it not easy for commuting students to be accepted as adults?", "What's the best solution if commuting students conflict with their parents?", "What does the passage mainly talk about?"], "article": "When you are admitted to a local university, especially one without accommodation, perhaps you'll live at home and become a commuting student which benefits you.

In 1907, after working with backward students, she was given a chance to try out her ideas on children. There were sixty children, aged three to six, in the Children's House. The rooms were bright and color1ful. Maria let the children make their own choice of what they wanted to do and work with their own speed. They became busy, peaceful and happy.\n  Maria Montessori was one of the world's great teachers. She traveled in Europe, Americaand Far East.

Clever researchers may be considered too young to have \"any right\" to present findings that do not agree with knowledge and wisdom of their elders.\nThe American is trained from children to question, analyze and search. \"Go look it up for yourself\", a child will be told. School tasks are designed to demand the use of a wide range of materials. An assignment to \"write a paper on the world's supply of sugar\" will send even a young child in search of completely unfamiliar ideas.

Foreign visitors are often surprised and frequently annoyed to find junior staff members \"daring\" to challenge older ones or argue points with them; they do not always like it when these young men make detailed but often revolutionary suggestions.

A very strong windstorm especially in the desert carries clouds of sand or dust that greatly reduces visibility. This wind is usually caused by convection currents  , which are created by intense heating of the ground, and is usually strong enough to move entire sand dunes. Air is unstable when heated, and this instability in the air will cause higher winds to mix with winds in the lower atmosphere, producing strong surface winds.\nSandstorms can disturb people's travel, and can sometimes destroy whole roads, and dry flat areas. Similar dust storms can be found on the planet Mars, and are thought to be seasonal. Today, the destruction of forests and too much farming of farmland can lead to sandstorms. Too much use of water resources can also cause sandstorms.\nIn the United States of America, sandstorms are rare because of the lack of large deserts and more importantly the development of proper agricultural techniques. The last recorded destructive sandstorm in American history was the Dust Bowl, which occurred on July 16, 1971 and was widely recorded by meteorologists  .\nTo protect themselves from sandstorms, some people wear protective suits. Special equipment can be fixed in some cars to prevent sand from getting into the engine. Sandstorms can cause coughs, and the sand and dust has also been known to carry \"infectious diseases\".

He did not begin his career as an artist until 1880; however, during the last ten years of his life, he produced more than 2,000 pieces, including around 900 paintings and 1,100 drawing and sketches  . He worked only with _ colours until he met Impressionism and Neo-Impressionism in Paris. Van Gogh used their bright colours and style of painting in a uniquely recognizable style. Most of his best-known works were produced during his final two years, when he was suffering from serious mental illness.\nIn 1890, at the age of 37, van Gogh shot himself in the chest. He died two days later, with Theo, his brother and his best friend, at his side, who reported his last words as \"The sadness will last forever\".

My family normally traveled eight city blocks to the home of my grandmother, where adults would sit on the front porch and chat while we children played hide-and-seek.\nThe Sunday visit was something to desire strongly.

For administrators, it is something else entirely: a device that lets them use radio frequency technology--with scanners tucked behind walls and ceilings--to track her whereabouts. \nAnson Jones is the first school in San Antonio's Northside Independent School District to roll out the new nametags, which are part of a pilot program   intended to ensure that the district receives all of the state dollars. \nIn Texas, school finance is a numbers game: schools receive money based on the number of students counted in their homeroom classes each morning. At Anson Jones, as at other schools, many students were in school but not in homeroom, so they were not counted and the district lost money, said Pascual Gonzalez, a spokesman for the district. \n\"We were leaving money on the table,\" he said, adding that the district expects a $2 million return on an initial investment of $261,000 in the technology at two pilot schools. \nBut the radio frequency identification nametags have prompted concerns from civil liberties groups and electronic privacy watchdogs, which fear a Big Brother atmosphere in Texas public schools. \nMatthew Simpson, a policy strategist for the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas, said the technology was easy to acquire, meaning people outside a school might be able to monitor a student if they obtained the student's unique tracking number. \nMr. Simpson said the technology was originally designed for shipping goods and for cattle. \"It was never intended for people,\" he said. \nBut students and educators at Anson Jones say they are excited about the practical advantages -- getting to eat lunch faster by scanning their bar codes in the lunch line, or being able to locate a child quickly in an emergency. \nNorthside is not the first district to use the tracking devices. Two Houston-area districts began the program several years ago. The Spring district, for example, started using the technology in 2004 as a way to track elementary students getting on and off buses. It expanded the program to high school students three years ago and has so far recovered $400,000, said Karen Garrison, a spokeswoman for the district. \n\"Our system still focuses on safety but has the added benefit of recovering average daily attendance funding,\" Ms. Garrison said. \nWendy Reyes, the principal of Anson Jones, said only one parent had complained about the program at her school. On the first day of classes at Jay High School, home to the other pilot program school in Northside, several parents staged a protest across the street from the school, though most did not have students in the district. \nMany students, teachers and parents at the middle school feel the technology's benefits outweigh privacy concerns, Ms. Reyes said.", "id": "high18644.txt"}, {"answers": ["B", "D", "C", "A"], "options": [["they live in a small village", "they have few fields", "they're too lazy to work", "nobody would help them to getmoney"], ["he wanted to get some grass in the water", "he wanted to look for a tortoise in the water", "he wanted to have a good rest in the water", "he wanted to have a swim"], ["head", "leg", "right hand", "left hand"], ["he did a very successful operation", "the farmer was lucky enough to write after the operation", "the accident helped the farmer to write", "he taught the farmer to write while he was staying in hospital"]], "questions": ["The Reads have little food because   _", "Mr. Read jumped into the river because    _", "Mr. Read's  _  was hurt in the traffic accident.", "What the doctor said meant that   _  ."], "article": "Mr. Read was born in a small village with high mountains all around it.He has few fields and he can't get enough food for his family.He's often worried about it.So he works harder and harder and tries his best to get more money. \nOne afternoon,Mr. Read went out to look for some grass for his cows.It was very hot and he had to have a swim.Suddenly he saw a big tortoise in the water.He swam there and caught it.The next morning he went to the town to sell it in the markets.When he was walking in the street, a car hit him down and he was hurt.He was sent to hospital at once.The doctors looked him over and had an operation on him.Two weeks later he felt much better.The doctors were satisfied with the operation and said,\"You'll be fully recovered in a week.We're sure you can write when you leave hospital.\" \n\"It's really a miracle \"shouted Mr. Read,\"I could neither read nor write before!\"", "id": "high23119.txt"}, {"answers": ["C", "A", "B"], "options": [["believe in early development in children", "are too busy to take care of their children", "don't want their children to lag behind", "want to repeat what their parents did to them"], ["to make them believe it's in their best interests", "to consider the matter from parents' standpoint", "to emphasize the importance of hard work from time to time", "to make it interesting and enjoyable to them"], ["reducing children's hard work and unnecessary activities", "resisting the superficial values of pop culture", "reducing more activity off their school schedule", "spending more time with their children"]], "questions": ["One of the reasons why parents push children so hard is that they  _  .", "The best way to encourage children to work hard is  _  .", "The new approach toward parenting mentioned in the passage most likely refers to   _  ."], "article": "Pushing children too hard is a really big social problem that seems to be getting worse.

Loud background noise, however, damaged their creativity. Ravi Mehta suggests there maybe some benefit to playing music or other sounds in an art class or other situations where creativity is the key.\nMany teachers all over the world already play music to students in class. Many are inspired by the belief that hearing music can boost IQ in their tasks, the so-called Mozart effect. While the evidence actually suggests it's a guess to say classical music boosts brainpower, researchers do think pleasant sounds before a task can sometimes lift your mood and help you perform well, says Ravi Mehta,\" If you like the music or you like the sound-even listening to a Stephen King novel-then you did better. It didn't matter about the music,\" he says.\nHowever, it's worth considering that music is not always helpful while you're trying to work. Trying to perform a task which involves serial recall - for instance, doing mental mathematics-will be distracted by sounds with audio variation, says Ravi Mehta.

Cameroon is a bilingual country with French and English as official languages, while there are also close to 200 local ethnic languages in a country of 16 million people. French is the _ language, spoken by about 80% of the population.\nThe local school system is very traditional and somewhat strict. Perhaps not surprisingly when there can be up to 150 students in the classroom (of which maybe 30 have the books, and there are probably seats for 70).\nLike anywhere else, students appreciate it if you know a bit about their country, and not just Roger Milla (the top scorer of the 1990 World Cup, in case you're wondering). It helps if you know the names of the ten provinces, know who the first president was, or can say a word in a local language.\nSo in conclusion: Cameroon isn't just football.

His father made him play when he was a child. He got bored, and became a rebel . The strict training that his father pushed upon him got in the way of his wild lifestyle.

He cut his long hair, got fitter and tightened up emotionally. On the court, he ranked No. 1 for almost two years. His lowest point came in 1997 when his ranking dropped to No. 141.

But in order to work up the desire to rewrite, it is important to learn to like what you write at the early stage.\nI am surprised at the number of famous writers I know who say that they so dislike reading their own writing later that they even hate to look over the publishers' opinions. One reason we may dislike reading our own work is that we're often disappointed that the rich ideas in our minds seem very thin and plain when first written down. Jerry Fodor and Steven Pinker suggest that this fact may be a result of how our minds work.\nDifferent from popular belief, we do not usually think in the works and sentences of ordinary language but in symbols for ideas (known as 'mentalese' ), and writing our ideas down is an act of translation from that symbolic language. But while mentalese contains our thoughts in the form of a complex tapestry  ,writing can only be composed one thread at a time. Therefore it should not be surprising that our first attempt at expressing ideas should look so simple. It is only by repeatedly rewriting that we produce new threads and connect them to get closer to the ideas formed in our minds.\nWhen people write as if some strict critics   are looking over their shoulder, they are so worried about what this critic might say that they get stuck before they even start. Peter Elbow makes an excellent suggestion to deal with this problem. When writing we should have two different minds. At the first stage, we should see every idea, as well as the words we use to express it, as wonderful and worth putting down. It is only during rewrites that we should examine what we excitedly wrote in the first stage and check for weaknesses.", "id": "high1243.txt"}, {"answers": ["B", "D", "A"], "options": [["there are few doctors there", "the nearest doctor is sometimes very far away from them", "there is always heavy traffic on the road", "they don't want to see a doctor"], ["by sea", "in a car", "on foot", "by air"], ["every family in the outback has a special medicine chest", "people in Australia are seldom ill", "a \"flying doctor\" is a man who flies people to hospital", "there are very few hospitals in Australia"]], "questions": ["Some people in the Australian outback can't get to a doctor quickly.

At first, visitors are often surprised to find that they have difficulty in understanding the accents and dialects of certain regions. Even in England there are many different dialects.\nExperts believe that for most English people, the places they come from are very important to them. Accents are clues to where people were born and where they grew up. Although some people may change the way they speak during their lifetime, most people carry at least some evidence of their accents and dialects throughout their lives. In addition to the regional accents of England, there can also be class differences among the accents. People are often able to make instant and unconscious judgments about a stranger's class by listening to his or her accent. Both the words and the pronunciation of an individual reflect his or her social position.\nIt is agreed that in England, the kind of English spoken by a person plays a leading role that generally is not important in North America. The importance of accents and their cultural and social relationships are well represented in films and on television in Britain. The film My Fair Lady based on George Bernard Shaw's 1912 play Pygmalion is often said to be a wonderful example of how social class and the accent were, and still are, linked in Britain.", "id": "high19201.txt"}, {"answers": ["B", "C"], "options": [["it is hard to make good interpersonal relationships", "there are several levels of relationships among people", "the success of different interpersonal relationships can be measured by needs", "the first step to establish a successful relationship is to know your own needs"], ["A child's needs change with his growth.", "A child should also know his parents' needs.", "It's easier to find your own needs than to find others'.", "You can learn what others need by their responses to you."]], "questions": ["From the passage we learn that   _  .", "Which of the following statements is NOT mentioned in the passage?"], "article": "The key to a good interpersonal relationship is simple once you understand the role that needs play in making a relationship weak, moderate, average, or strong.\nA person who fails in a relationship is someone who neglects the needs of his or her partner. So the first step to establish a successful relationship is to find out what needs the other person has. It is also very important to understand your own needs so that you can help the other person in the relationship to meet your needs.\nUnfortunately, not only do many people fail to see or to understand their partner's needs, but they do not understand their own. Children have wonderful relationships with their parents as long as their needs are being satisfied. When the needs are not satisfied, the relationship changes and problems arise. As a child grows, needs change; it is necessary that parents recognize these changes. As it is with the child to the parents, it is also with the parents to the child.\nThe way to recognize the needs of other people is by their responses to you. When you do or say something and you get a positive response, you are well on the way to being recognized. The same goes for you. What is it that you respond to in a positive manner? What do you feel good about getting and about doing? What are you totally guiltless about? What can you do with complete confidence and fearlessness? What emotional scene can you control without fear or guilt? Look in these areas for your needs and you will in all probability find your answers.\nAs stated, our own needs are often hidden.

The word tycoon is relatively new to the English language. It is Chinese in origin but was given as a title to some Japanese generals. The term was brought to the United States, in the late nineteenth century, where it eventually was used to refer to magnates who acquired immense fortunes from sugar and cattle, coal and oil, rubber and steel, and railroads. Some people called these tycoons \"capitals of industry\" and praised them for their contributions to U.S. wealth and international reputation. Others criticized them as cruel \"robber barons\", who would stop at nothing in pursuit of personal wealth.\nThe early tycoons built successful businesses, often taking over smaller companies to eliminate competition. A single company that came to control an entire market was called a monopoly. Monopolies made a few families very wealthy, but they also placed a heavy financial burden on consumers and the economy at large.\nAs the country expanded and railroads linked the East Coast to the West Coast, local monopolies turned into national corporations called trusts. A trust is a group of companies that join together under the control of a board of trustees. Railroad trusts are an excellent example. Railroads were privately owned and operated and often monopolized various routes, setting rates as high as they desired. The financial burden this placed on passengers and businesses increased when railroads formed trusts. Farmers, for example, had no choice but to pay, as railroads were the only means they could use to get their grain to buyers. Exorbitant   goods rates put some farmers out of business.\nThere were even accusations that the trusts controlled government itself by buying votes and manipulating elected officials. In 1890 Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust. Act, legislation aimed at breaking the power of such trusts. The Sherman Antitrust Act focused on two main issues. First of all, it made illegal any effort to interfere with the normal conduct of interstate trade. It also made it illegal to monopolize any part of business that operates across state lines.\nOver the next 60 years or so, Congress passed other antitrust laws in an effort to encourage competition and restrict the power of larger corporations.", "id": "high10024.txt"}, {"answers": ["D", "D", "A", "C"], "options": [["He is born with intelligence.", "Intelligence is the result of where and how one lives.", "He works much harder than others.", "People are still not sure of the answer."], ["whose parents are clever", "often thinking about difficult problems", "often helped by his parents and teachers", "born with a good brain and putting it into active use"], ["to praise and encourage their children more often", "to be hard on their children", "to leave their children alone with nothing to do", "to give their children as much help as possible"], ["Parents play an important part in their children's growth.", "The less you use your mind,the duller you may become.", "Intelligence is obviously the result of where you were born.", "What makes a person bright or stupid is still under discussion."]], "questions": ["Why is one person more intelligent than another?", "A person     is more likely to become a genius.", "It is better for parents    .", "Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage?"], "article": "What makes one person more intelligent than another?What makes one person a genius,like the brilliant Albert Einstein,and another person a fool?Are people born intelligent or stupid,or is intelligence the result of where and how you live?These are very old questions but the answers to them are still not clear.\nWe know,however,that just being born with a good mind is not enough.In some ways,the mind is like a leg or an arm muscle.It needs exercise.Mental exercise is particularly important for young children.Many child psychologists think that parents should play with their children more often and give them problems to think about.The children are then more likely to grow up bright and intelligent.If,on the other hand,children are left alone a great deal with nothing to do,they are more likely to become dull and unintelligent.\nParents should also be careful with what they say to young children.According to some psychologists,if parents are always telling a child that he or she is a fool or an idiot,then the child is more likely to keep doing silly and foolish things.So it is probably better for parents to say very positive things to their children,such as\"That was a very clever thing you did\"or\"You are such a smart child\".", "id": "high18699.txt"}, {"answers": ["C", "A", "B"], "options": [["Because they are healthy.", "Because they are happy.", "Because they want to live longer.", "All the above."], ["their favourite team wins", "they win the game", "they get the good news", "they can't help themselves"], ["they train their character in the game", "they understand each other", "they are friendly to each other", "they help each other"]], "questions": ["Why do people all over the world enjoy sports?", "Why do some people get excited when they watch a game?

When I reached for one of the two remaining glasses, Tom stopped my arm. \"Drop that! Take the other.\" he whispered. I did so. Henry was served last. He had hardly swallowed his drink when the clock struck midnight. His face grew paler and paler. \"Boys,\" he said, \"I am sick with fear. Help! I want to lie down.\" Henry was asleep almost before the words were out of his mouth.\nIn a moment, those handy men had his clothes off and tucked him into his bed. They seemed to be getting ready to leave. So I said, \"Please don't go, gentlemen. She won't know me. I am a stranger.\" They glanced at each other. Then Joe said, \"She?

Mental health problems can lead to school failure,alcohol or other drug abuse ,family violence,or even suicide.\nThere are many signs that may point to a possible mental health problem in a child or teenager. If you are worried about a child or have any questions,look for help at once. Talk to your doctor,a school teacher,or other mental health experts who are trained to know whether your child has a mental health problem.

As a volunteer I was providing emotional support for people with health related problems. Empathic listening really made a difference on how patients felt about their health problems. By sharing about their pain and suffering and my willingness to listen, they felt less alone.\nWe can make life easier for each other by becoming a better listener and encouraging each other to share our feelings. We can become a better listener by avoiding giving advice and trying to solve problems unless we are asked to do so. Pressuring others to solve their life problems--\"our ways\"-- is not helpful. Most people intuitively   know how to solve their own problems. As a listener it's important to be patient and not to interrupt the speaker. Let them know it's OK to talk about their feelings and support them in feeling their feelings.\nWhen one neither shares nor reaches out for support, he or she can remain a lonely mystery. Life can feel lonely when one keeps everything inside. Feeling alone with life problems can be worse than the problem itself.

Children as young as five years old often give brief talks about objects they bring in to school - called \"show and tell,\" and this training is a basis for later public speaking. Even so, many native English-speaking adults are afraid to speak or give presentations in front of a large group.\nSpeaking English in public meetings is necessary for many students and employees. The best way to improve is to practice public speaking in a friendly environment. Learners need to receive feedback about what they are doing well and about their mistakes. One group that gives members the chance to practice is Toastmasters. Toastmasters is an international organization that holds weekly meetings. At the meetings, members each give a speech and give others advice about their speeches and speaking style.\nCharles LeBeau is a public speaking professor and consultant. He began his career in Japan in 1982. Currently, he teaches at two universities and at the Toshiba International Training Center. He has also written books on the subject.\nEnglish language learners around the world use his book Speaking of Speech. Speaking of Speech tells about a method of teaching public speaking for non-native speakers. Mr. LeBeau says a simple approach helps English learners.\n\"The approach that I've taken is to simplify and break it down. First if we look at a presentation, what's going on, there are basically three messages that the presenter is giving the audience, all simultaneously . There's what I call the physical message. Physical message is basically body language. It's the way that my body, as a speaker, is talking to the audience. And then there's also the visual message. The visual messages are the slides that we now make and show the audience. The third message is the story message. The story message is the content of our presentation. So another way we can think of the story messages is that it's the verbal message, and it's what we say to the audience. The story message also includes how we organize our ideas to present to the audience,\" LeBeau said.", "id": "high9987.txt"}, {"answers": ["D", "A", "D", "B"], "options": [["Earth's Poles Interest Scientists", "The Animals of Earth's Poles", "Earth's Poles in Danger", "The Discoveries of Earth's Poles"], ["to make it clear that the poles have much to do with a healthy earth", "to provide practical theory to further develop this distant area", "to call on as many scientists as possible to do research on the poles", "to discover more mysteries unknown to man"], ["The increasing number of animals.", "The development of the poles.", "The melting of the poles.", "The rising temperature."], ["In summer the ice of the Arctic loses faster.", "The ice covering the Arctic shrinks even in winter.", "The ice of the Arctic increases less than in the past.", "The changes in the Arctic are more serious."]], "questions": ["Which of the following might be the best tile of the passage?", "The goal of the International Polar Year is   _  .", "What is the main factor that has caused the changes of the poles?", "What unusual phenomenon worries the scientists?"], "article": "The North and South poles are remote and freezing places that receive lots of animal visitors but few human tourists.\nBut even if you never plan to visit the polar bears in the north or penguins in the south, now is a perfect time to start thinking about them.

During the IPY, which will last until March 2009, thousands of researchers from more than 60 countries will conduct more than 200 projects and expeditions  to both the top and bottom of the world.\nIn recent years, the polar regions have begun to change severely as a result of global warming. Temperatures there are rising faster than anywhere else on Earth. As a result, the ice and snow in these regions are melting  at record-setting rates. One result is that sea levels are rising around the world, putting animals and people at risk.\nOnly by studying the poles, say IPY researchers, can we find ways to protect them and ourselves.\nBoth the Arctic and the Antarctic are cold and remote, but the two regions have important differences. For one thing, the Arctic is an ice-covered ocean surrounded by land. The Antarctic, on the other hand, is a continent of ice-covered land surrounded by water.\nMost polar studies have focused on the Arctic, and that is where scientists have observed the most remarkable changes in the ice. During a typical year, Arctic ice expands  in the winter and shrinks  in the summer.

We do not tell each other what is disturbing us. The result is emotional difficulty of one kind or another. By using the quiet family hour to discuss our problems, we might get to know each other better, and to like each other better.\nOn evenings when such talk is unnecessary, families could rediscover more active entertainments. Freed from TV, forced to find their own activities, they might take a ride together to watch the sunset.

There is more entertainment in a good book than in a month of typical TV programming.

A more cultured new generation could be a product of the quiet hour.\nAt first glance, the idea of an hour without TV seems radical  . What will parents do without the electronic baby-sitter? How will we spend the time? But it's not radical at all. It has been only twenty-five years since television came to control our free time.

A scientist even says that next year, or maybe the year after that, the Arctic will be free of ice.\nPeter Wadhams, a scientist, said that the melting trend led to his statement. \"Most people expect this year will see a record low in the Arctic's summer sea-ice cover. Next year or the year after that, I think it will be free of ice in summer and by that I mean the central Arctic will be ice-free,\" Peter Wadhams, director of the Scott Polar Institute in Cambridge, said in an interview withthe Guardian. \"You will be able to cross over the North Pole by ship,\" Peter Wadhams added. He strongly believes that although some pieces of ice will remain, the Arctic basin may be free of sea ice in the next two years starting in the summer of 2017.\nWadhams' study says that melting sea ice will have a great influence on the planet since the sea ice is more capable of reflecting   sunlight compared to water that can only reflect 10% of the sunlight. Once the sea ice melts, the water can only reflect a small amount of sunlight. This means that the Earth will receive and absorb more sunlight, making the planet even hotter.\nThe year 2016 has already broken records of the hottest temperature ever recorded and the trend doesn't seem to show any decrease in global warming. \"It doesn't look like the ice is healing and growing back,\" Tom Wagner, NASA's manager for cryosphere   research said in a statement.\nLike Wadhams, scientists and researchers all over the world are lecturing around to educate people to help lighten global warming that has already changed the planet's landscape.", "id": "high14948.txt"}, {"answers": ["D", "B", "A", "A"], "options": [["there are more young people than old people", "an increasing number of old people are dying", "more and more young people are growing old", "the percentage of old people in the world is increasing"], ["Indifferent.", "Optimistic.", "Negative.", "Worried."], ["are facing the risk of failing", "have failed to provide support for the old", "will be replaced by other support systems", "have greatly affected the nations' economies"], ["should prepare for population aging", "don't see population aging as an issue", "are facing urgent situations of population aging", "have better ways to deal with population aging"]], "questions": ["\"Aging\" in this text means .", "What is Professor Richard Lee's attitude towards population aging?", "The publicly-funded support systems in industrialized nations.", "We can infer from the text that developing nations."], "article": "The United States estimates that about one out of every 10 people on the planet today is at least 60 years old.

With more people living longer, it could get expensive. But Mr. Lee says with continuing increases in worker productivity and smart planning, it can be manageable.\nSocieties have different methods for caring for the elderly, but each carries a cost. Generally, there are three types of support. Seniors can live off the wealth they gained when they were younger. They can rely on their family to take care of them, or they can rely on the government.\nIn industrialized nations, governments created publicly-funded   support systems. These worked relatively well until recent years, when aging population growth in places like the United States and Western Europe began to gradually weaken the systems finances. These nations now face some tough choices. Mr. Lee says the elderly in some of these countries must either receive less money, retire later or increase taxes to make the system continuable.\nMost developing nations haven't built this type of government-funded support, but have instead relied on families to care for their elderly. These nations also generally have a much younger population, which means their situation is not as urgent as more developed nations. But Mr. Lee says that doesn't mean they can ignore the issue. \"Third World countries should give very careful thought to this process, to population aging and how it may affect their economies -- now, before population aging even becomes an issue,\" he explained.", "id": "high13165.txt"}, {"answers": ["D", "A", "B"], "options": [["St. Paul's Cathedral", "the Tower of London", "Westminster Abbey", "Buckingham Palace"], ["Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey", "Buckingham Palace and St. Paul's Cathedral", "Westminster Abbey and the Tower of London", "the Tower of London and St. Paul's Cathedral"], ["A history book about London.", "A guidebook for visitors to London.", "A book about London's development.", "A book about London's churches."]], "questions": ["You can see the inside of all the buildings all the year around except    _   .", "The two places you can visit by getting off at the same underground station are    _   .", "Where is the text most probably taken from?"], "article": "St. Paul's Cathedral\nLudgate Hill, EC4\nUnderground: St. Paul's; Bus: 6, 8, 11, 15, 22, 25\nOpen: Daily 8:00-19:00 (17:00 from Oct. to Mar.)\nEntrance free\nDesigned by the great architect, Sir Christopher Wren, St. Paul's Cathedral was built following the Great Fire of London of 1666, which destroyed the gothic cathedral on the site at that time.

This knowledge helped them to live a better life than most people of that time.\nIn ancient Mexico there were many small clearings in the forest. In each clearing was a village with fields of crops around it. The Maya planted seeds after they cleared the land. A farmer was able to grow crops that produced for several people. But not every Maya had to be a farmer. Some were builders or priests  .\nThe Maya believed in many gods. They built large temples to honor them. Skillful workers built cities around these temples. It was difficult because they had to carry all of the building materials themselves. Today, many of these ancient Mayan cities and temples are still standing.\nAlthough the Maya worked hard to build the beautiful cities, very few of them lived in them. Usually, only the priests lived in the cities. The other people lived in small villages in the forests. Their houses were much simpler. Most Maya lived a simple life close to nature.\nMeasuring time correctly was important to the Maya, so Mayan priests made a system to keep track of time. They wrote numbers as dots ( ... ) and bars ( -- ). They also made a calendar  . The year was divided into 18 months of 20 days each with five days left over.\nAround the year 800, the Maya left their villages and beautiful cities, never to return. No one knows why this happened. They may have died from a deadly disease. They may have left because the soil could no longer grow crops.

The words \" _ \" are now part of the language of tourism, and it is the museums and works of art in many countries that are their main attractions.\nIf they are lucky--and have had sensible, strong governments--many countries also usually have at least a few beautiful places for tourists to visit.\nFinally there is perhaps a nation's greatest attraction: its people. A nation is not just its historical buildings, its works of art or beautiful places, it is also the people who live in it. This is why a country such as Thailand attracts millions of people every year. They come mainly because of the friendliness of the Thai people. It is why the Pacific Islands are also so popular. There may not be much to see or do in Fiji, but there are lots of friendly, smiling people to make visitors feel welcome.", "id": "high12475.txt"}, {"answers": ["C", "C", "D"], "options": [["have a bridesmaid", "wear a veil as a bride", "wear a white wedding dress", "wear a casual dress for the reception"], ["protect guests", "comfort brides", "trick evil spirits", "bring good fortune"], ["by time", "by space", "by process", "by comparison"]], "questions": ["Queen Victoria is said to be the first woman in Britain to   _  .", "According to superstitious beliefs, having bridesmaids is to   _  .", "The passage is mainly developed   _  ."], "article": "People around the world have their own ways of celebrating weddings. Now let's compare Eastern and Western weddings.\nChinese and Indian brides normally wear red dresses and most of the wedding decorations are of the same color. This is because the color red is said to bring good fortune. In many Eastern weddings, especially Chinese weddings, the bride will change into a different dress after the ceremony. White dresses only arrived in modern times because of the influence of Western wedding dress designs.\nWestern wedding dresses are different. Brides usually wear a wedding dress that is white in color and wear it throughout the whole wedding. Wearing white wedding dresses is said to have started in the 1840s, beginning with Queen Victoria, Queen of Great Britain. There are occasions when brides dress into more comfortable clothing so that they will be able to move more freely during the wedding reception.\nTraditional practices are strictly followed for most Western weddings. The couple follow up with any plans they have agreed and decided on to make their special wedding day unique and memorable. Wedding receptions and other celebrations differ among the East and the West, but the concept is still the same. They are held to show gratitude towards family members, friends and guests for being a part of the wedding ceremony.\nAnother common custom that weddings of the East and the West have is the wearing of the wedding veil . According to superstitious  beliefs, the bride wears a veil to protect her from being seen by evil spirits and the bridesmaids are decoys .

Tests with artificial stars have proved conclusively that certain night-flying birds are able to follow the stars in their long-distance flights.\nOne such bird, a warbler  , had spent its lifetime in a cage and had never flown under a natural sky. Yet it showed an inborn ability to use the stars for guidance. The bird's cage was placed under an artificial star-filled sky at migration time. The bird tried to fly in the same direction as that taken by his outdoor cousins. Any change in the direction of the make-be-live stars caused a change in the direction of his flight. Scientists think that warblers, when flying in daylight, use the sun for guidance. But the stars are apparently their main means of navigation  . What do they do when the stars are hidden by clouds?

Quality of life is the degree of overall satisfaction that a person gets from life.\nWhy has the emphasis of health shifted from the absence of disease to a broader focus on the quality of a person's life?

Children enter their frogs in the jumping contest during National Tom Sawyer Days. There's also a fence painting contest to see who can paint the fastest.

It's estimated that owners will spend about $55.5 billion on goods and services for their pets this year, up about $2 billion from last year.\nThat's a small price to pay for the unconditional love and loyalty you get from a pet. The bond between dog and dog owner began about 30,000 years ago when dogs started to become domesticated  . Since then, dogs have become faithful companions not only at home but also as service dogs, in the workplace and on the battlefield.\nIn addition to the unconditional love, companionship and sense of security that comes with dog ownership, there are also many health benefits.

We can choose to be happy, and we can do a lot to add happiness to our lives.\nWhat is happiness? It is a feeling of inner peace and satisfaction. It is usually experienced when there are no worries, fears or confused thoughts, and this usually happens when we do something we love to do or when we win, gain or achieve something that we value. It seems to be the outcome of positive events, but it actually comes from the inside, triggered by outer events.\nFor most people happiness seems passing quickly. One of the best ways to keep it, is by gaining inner peace through daily meditation . As the mind becomes more peaceful, it becomes easier to choose the happiness habit.\nHere are a few tips for increasing happiness in daily life:\nTry hard to change the way you look at things.

Then that part is made stronger.\nThe most dangerous test happens when the new plane is going through test flights in the air.

This is a common problem for millions of children around the world. Many families use kerosene oil   lamps. There are many problems with these lamps. They produce only a small amount of light. They are dangerous to breathe. And they are a big fire danger, causing many injuries and deaths each year. Kerosene costs less than other forms of lighting, but it is still costly in poor countries.

He began experimenting with light-emitting diodes  , LEDs, at his lab. As a professor of renewable energy, he already knew about the technology. Light-emitting diodes are small glass lamps that use much less electricity than traditional bulbs   and last much longer. He used a one-watt bright white LED made in Japan.

It allows students to develop broad intellectual and cultural understanding; it nurtures creativity and deepens participation in public discourse and modem democracy.\nThe commission's report points out that \"at the very moment when China is seeking to adopt our model of broad education in the humanities, social sciences and natural sciences as a stimulus to  invention, the United States is instead narrowing our focus and abandoning our sense of what education has been and should continue to be - our sense of what makes America great.\"\nThese are the telling statistics: First, federal funding for helping American students include international training in their education has been cut 41 percent in four years. Second, the National  Assessment of Educational Progress test shows that only less than a quarter of eighth- and 12th-grade US students are proficient in reading, writing and civics.\nHow can we possibly equip the US for its leadership role in an increasingly connected world if we are not adequately teaching students to communicate and helping them understand and encounter diverse perspectives? If we fail to invest in the arts and humanities, our country's future leaders will not have the ability to connect on an emotional level with others. This ability is developed by studying the humanities, and in the global community this skill is not optional - it's essential.\nIn a word, we must enthusiastically support and fund the study of the arts and humanities. For anyone concerned with how this translates into a sound economy and a sound financial future, simply recall what Steve Jobs told graduates of Standford University in 2005: One of the most influential experiences in his brief time at Reed College was his exposure to the fine art of calligraphy . It taught him the important lesson of the relationship between discipline and creativity.", "id": "high18810.txt"}, {"answers": ["D", "B", "A"], "options": [["The garden was dug by Grandparents during the Great Depression.", "The garden provided enough food and flowers for the family.", "The garden was made smaller as Grandparents grew older.", "The garden once lay in waste after Grandpa passed away."], ["Grandma was too busy to hire someone to deal with the bees.", "Grandma felt very lonely and helpless when Grandpa passed away.", "Frank hired beekeepers to help Grandma keep the garden growing.", "Grandpa turned into bees to help Grandma keep up the garden."], ["Grandpa's Bees", "Grandparents' Garden", "The Harvest of Summer", "The Secret of the Garden"]], "questions": ["According to the passage, which of the following is NOT true?", "It can be inferred from the passage that   _  .", "Which of the following is the best title for the passage?"], "article": "A long time before I was born, my grandma and grandpa had a young family of four little girls. During the Great Depression  , work was hard to find, so Grandpa did whatever jobs he could. On weekends he and Grandma dug a garden to grow some of their own food.\nEverybody worked to keep the garden growing. All summer long, the family ate food and enjoyed flowers from the garden. Grandma put up strawberry jam, tomatoes, beans, peppers, pears and peaches in canning jars. They were good to eat through the long winter.\nThe family grew up, and grandparents grew old. It became hard to keep up the garden, so they made it a little smaller. There was still plenty to eat from the garden and lovely flowers to enjoy.\nThen one summer when Grandpa was eighty-nine years old, all he could do was watch from his lawn chair as the vegetables grew and the roses bloomed. Summer slowly faded, and Grandpa died before it was time to bring in the harvest.\nIt was a lonely winter for Grandma. She sat near the window, looking out at the yard and wondering if she could plant a garden in the spring. When spring came, she planted only a little garden.\nOne sunny day in the early summer, Grandma heard a commotion   in the front yard and looked out the window to see a frightening sight. A huge swarm of bees filled the air between two tall trees. The buzzing sound was very loud.\nThe bees made their way into a hole up in one of the trees. Before long, every one of those bees had disappeared into its new home. During the next few days, the bees were busy minding their own business. Grandma could always see a few bees buzzing in and out around the opening high in the tree. Before long, she decided the bees weren't bothering anyone, so she didn't give them another thought.\nThat summer, Grandma's little garden grew and grew. _ \nOne day, Grandma's brother Frank visited from Arizona. As Grandma made Frank a delicious lunch of squash cakes and homemade applesauce, she told him the story about the swarm of bees. Frank said, \"In Arizona, the farmers often hired beekeepers to set up beehives near their fields. The bees pollinated   the crops and helped them to grow.\"\nThat was when Grandma realized that her bees had helped with her garden all summer. \"So that's why my little garden had such a big crop!\" she exclaimed.\nFrom that time on, Grandma always believed that since Grandpa couldn't be there to help her that summer, he had sent the bees to take his place and make Grandma's little garden grow and grow.", "id": "high11964.txt"}, {"answers": ["B", "C", "D", "A"], "options": [["planes and motorcars have taken the place of trains", "oil is expensive today", "trains are slow", "railways lose money"], ["It is cheaper to travel by train than by plane.", "The railway station is usually at the center of the city.", "When you get off the plane you will find yourself right in the city center.", "No motorcar or plane can carry as many goods as a train does."], ["we can have a smooth and untroubled journey", "we'll not have enough money to fly in planes", "we can now travel in super-fast train", "all of the above"], ["Not the End but the Beginning", "Which is the Best: Train, Motorcar or Plane", "Trains are More Competitive than Motorcars or Planes", "Oh, Super-fast Trains"]], "questions": ["Some people think the railways are unnecessary for many reasons except that  _  .", "According to the writer, which of the following is Not true?", "The writer thinks that the railways, far from being dead, are very much alive because  _  .", "The best title for this passage may be\"  _  \""], "article": "For years and years people have been saying that the railways are dead. \" We can do without railways.\" People say...as if motorcars and planes have made the railways unnecessary.

If you want to carry people or goods from place to place, they are cheaper than planes. And they have much in common with planes. A plane goes in a straight line and so does a railway. What is more, it takes you from the heart of a city into the heart of another. It doesn't leave you up as a plane does, miles and miles from the city center.

Moreover, he says, \"over the long sweep of history, women have been and will be a peaceful force.

Margaret Thatcher,Golda Meir, and Indira Gandhi were powerful women; all of them led their countries to war.\nBut it is also true that these women rose to leadership by playing according to the political rules of \"a man's world.\" It was their success consistent with male values that enabled their rise to leadership in the first place. In a world in which women were in the majority of leadership positions, they might behave differently in power.\nSo we are left with the broader question: does gender really matter in leadership? In terms of traditional opinion, various psychological studies show that men tend towards the hard power of command, while women are cooperative and naturally understand the soft power of attraction and persuasion.\nThe key choices about war and peace in our future will depend not on gender, but on how leaders combine hard and soft power skills to produce smart policies.

According to time magazine's Richard Corliss, Lawrence is a rare young actress who lends mature intelligence to any role.\nThough Lawrence has found great success through her big screen work, she wasn't sure what she really liked doing before the age of 14. She thought she'd go to college and maybe find a career as a doctor or a travel agent.\nLawrence's two brothers were star athletes and one of them was a straight-A student. Unlike them, she suffered through school, never finding where she belonged. However, during a trip to New York, Lawrence suddenly realized that she wanted to be an actress. When she was enjoying the beautiful city, a model seeker asked if he could take her picture, and the next day he called her in for an audition .\n\"I read the script and it was the first time I had that feeling like I understand this,\" Lawrence said. \"Within 20 minutes in the cab ride from the hotel, I decided I didn't want to be a model. In fact, I wanted to be an actress.\" Having appreciated this young lady's performance, the agency was so impressed with her reading that they signed her on the spot. But she insisted on finishing high school so she could pay her full attention to her acting career.\nLawrence burst onto the Hollywood scene last year with The Hunger Games, which established her as the highest-grossing female action hero of all time.

They appreciated the tricky point that any major change can be stressful. Bad events like \"serious illness of a family member\" were high on the list, but so were some helpful life-changing events like marriage.\nWhen you take the Holmes-Rahe test you must remember that the score does not show how you deal with stress ---it only shows how much you have to deal with. And we now know that the way you deal with these events dramatically affects your chances of staying healthy. By the early 1970s, hundreds of similar studies had followed Holmes and Rahe. And millions of Americans who work and live under stress worried over the reports. Somehow the research got boiled down to a memorable message. Women's magazines ran titles like \"Stress causes illness\".\nIf you want to stay physically and mentally healthy the articles said avoid stressful events. But such simplistic advice is impossible to follow. Even if stressful events are dangerous, many -- like the death of a loved one -- are impossible to avoid. Moreover, any warning to avoid all stressful events is a prescription for staying away from chances as well as trouble. Since any change can be stressful, a person who wanted to be completely free of stress would never marry, have a child, take a new job or move.

Foreign tourists are often advised to learn some bargaining skills so that they can avoid paying high prices. Generally speaking, bargaining is an art and an important part of people's life in China.\nBut the younger generation is gradually losing interest and the ability to negotiate a better deal. With fatter wallets, young people who never experienced war or shortages seldom bother to spend 10 minutes at a roadside shop cutting the price of a cell phone cover by 1 yuan. Saving for a rainy day and making good use of every penny---values held dear by older generations---no longer seem necessary. Naturally, bargaining is out, in an increasingly rich society. In this sense, bargaining is a product of poverty.\nBut in many countries, where residents' incomes are much lower than those in China, bargaining is not popular at all. I can still remember my failed bargaining attempts in Africa and Indonesia, where vendor  looked at me in surprise when I sought something at half the price. They shook their heads and stopped the negotiation. Latter I was told by friends who had been staying there for years that bargaining was not part of local commercial culture.\nDuring the years when the planned economy changed into the market economy, it was difficult for ordinary buyers to get a full picture of the product prices at a time when travel was inconvenient, and information spread slowly, adding to the information asymmetry . Afraid of being overcharged by vendors, buyers turned to the old wisdom of bargaining whenever and wherever they could.\nNowadays, the popularity of e-commerce has improved pricing transparence  to the extreme. With the click of a mouse, all kinds of information on a product can be found, with users' comments helping new consumers make decisions. With such transparency, overpricing becomes less frequent and bargaining is not a necessity for shoppers. In this sense, reduced bargaining activity can be seen as a sign of China's progress toward a more mature economy.", "id": "high10042.txt"}, {"answers": ["A", "C", "B"], "options": [["He cut in the line.", "He hit Henry on the head.", "He hurried away without paying.", "He ran into Henry suddenly."], ["The author was not angry at all with what the man had done.", "The man was very sorry for what he had done to Henry.", "At last, Henry learned a very valuable life lesson from the event.", "Henry didn't help the author pick up the onions for the man."], ["Narrow-minded.", "Broad-minded.", "Strong-willed.", "Bad-tempered."]], "questions": ["What did the man do?", "What can we infer from the passage?", "Which of the following word can best describe the author?"], "article": "Weekends are normally a time for shopping and last Saturday was no exception.

urban schools were reporting dropout rates between 35 and 50 percent.Some administrators believe that dropout remains the single greatest problem in their schools.\nConsequently, much effort has been spent on identifying students with problems in order to give them more attention before they become failures.Since the dropout problem doesn't only start in senior high school, special programs in junior high school focus on students who show promise but have a record of truancy, that is, staying away from school without permission.Under the guidance of counselors  , these students are placed in classes with teachers who have had success in working with similar young people.Ways to motivate students in high school include rewarding academic excellence by electing scholars of the month, or by giving out clothing, such as school letter jackets formally given only to athletes.No one working with these students claims to know how to keep all students in school.Counselors, teachers, and

10:35 a.m. on December 17, 1903, two brothers from Ohio flew the first successful airplane for 12 seconds and 120 feet along a beach in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. With Orville flying first, the brothers took turns as pilot, and they flew three more times that day. On their fourth try, they managed to go 852 feet in 59 seconds ----an amazing feat at the time. The two brothers had invented powered flight. \nOrville and Wilbur Wright owned a bicycle shop in Dayton, Ohio. Although they had not gone to school to learn about airplanes or engineering, they were good mechanics. By repairing bicycles, they had learned how gears and pulleys worked. They also learned to take careful notes about what they saw. Each time they made a new design and tested a machine, they took notes and made drawings. They would study these to figure out what they could do better the next time.\nBefore the Wright brothers flew, they did many things to prepare for this extraordinary achievement. They read everything they could find about air, balloons, and kites. Then they made careful sketches of what they wanted to build. They began by making model kites to learn how air flowed over wings. They made them bigger and bigger until they had a glider -- a kite that is big enough to hold a person, but with no engine. The Wright brothers made three gliders before building their first airplane. Each time they made a glider, they would test it, make careful observations, and then improve their design. \nWhen they made a glider that flew well, they added an engine. This step was harder than it sounds, because they had to find an engine that was both light-weight and powerful. The engines that they could buy were either too heavy or too weak, so they asked their friend Charlie Taylor to help them build one. The first engine that Charlie built broke almost immediately, but the second one worked well.   \nAfter Orville and Wilbur installed the engine in their plane, they were almost ready. They simply had to wait for the perfect day with just the fight amount of wind. On the morning of December 17, 1903, they had their chance.

Other strategies may include providing alternate paths for gravity loads in the event that a load-bearing column fails. \"We also need a better understanding of the mechanism of collapse,\" said A.

We are also influenced by the fashion industry's advertising.\nThe stars of popular culture are always searching for a new angle to maintain their popularity. Often these new angles come in the form of new clothing or hairstyles. When people see these new styles, they often want to imitate  their favorite stars. To do so, they seek out the latest fashions to make themselves look like the people they want to imitate.

Cheating is a major concern in all academic environments. Students are creating new and more outrageous  ways of cheating every day; some claim that certain accounts of cheating can be justified, but overall it can always be prevented.\nCheating has been around forever, and millions of ways to cheat have been fashioned. Copying homework and cheat sheets are some of the most basic ways students in all education levels have cheated. Some students think nothing about writing a few answers on their hand, in a gum wrapper, or boldly using a study guide to cheat. Desperate students have even gone as far as to steal the test or scan in bottle wrappers and put answers into the nutrition label. The internet has now become available in almost every location. Computers can be accessed at school, at home, and now even on cell phones. This opens a doorway for even more methods of cheating to be born.\nThere are countless opinions on whether or not cheating can be justified. The truth is this behavior will always be a matter of opinion with each scenario of cheating. Students often rationalize their cheating by claiming they forgot to look over the material or did not understand what the teacher or professor was saying. Some may counter these arguments by saying that the student could have set reminders or asked the teacher to explain the material before the day of the test. Some other reasons students believe cheating is justified are their heavy workloads and trying to find time for school, sports, friends, and family. This may be true in certain instances, however, all students have these problems, and it is unfair to the students refrain  from cheating when the student who is dishonest receives a better grade. The majority of students who think cheating is acceptable may believe the reason for this is that sometimes students are unaware they are cheating, there is not enough time given for assignments, or that the information is too much for the course.\nIt may be difficult to accomplish, but cheating can be prevented. Teachers and professors have tried many options to stop cheating. These options can range anywhere from simply spreading test-takers out in a room, to expelling  a student, which will most likely hindertheir plans of getting into another college. One simple way to fix the problem is to scold the student when caught. They may be so scared or embarrassed that they never do it again. This is a risky way to prevent cheating in some cases, however, because it can possibly damage self-esteem. Another simple way to avoid cheating is to create many different kinds of the same test. This prohibits students from getting the answers off of a neighbor's test, but students still have the option of using other cheating tactics.\nThere may be a million ways to cheat and get away with it, but there are few times, if any, that it is justified. Cheating never has to be a necessity and is never worth compromising morals and losing years worth of working towards a degree.

From eagles to lions, many countries use an animal to show its national spirit and character.\nThe image of an eagle is on the US President's flag, and on the one-dollar bill. The bald eagle is a large, powerful, brown bird with a white head and tail. The term \"bald\" does not mean that this bird lacks feathers. Instead, it comes from the old word piebald, that menas, \"marked with white\".\nThe US declared that the eagle was its national bird in 1782. It was chosen because of \"its long life, great strength, and noble looks\".\nA few eagles have even become American heroes. An eagle named \"Old Abe\", the mascot of a Wisconsin troop of soldiers during the Civil War, traveled 14,000 miles with its men. He was often shot at by the enemy, but survived 42 battles.\nBut, one of the Founding Fathers, Benjamin Franklin didn't agree with the choice. \"The bald eagle ... is a bird of bad moral character, like those among men who live by robbing, he is generally poor, and often very messy,\" he argued. Franklin wanted the turkey as the country's national bird.\nIf Americans chose their national symbol deliberately, the symbol of England arose out of history.\nKing Herry I(1068-1135) was a brave warrior but also wise. His appreciation for the rule of law earned him the nickname the Lion of Justice. He was the first English King to use a lion as a royal symbol, which is popularly known as the \"king of the jungle\". By the year Richard I, known as \"The Lionheart\" for his bravery, came to the throne in 1189, the famous Three Lions badge had been formed. Now it can be seen on the shirts of England's sports teams.\nAlthough people might not think of lions when they think of England, everyone knows about the Australian kangaroo. Legend has it that the kangaroo gets its name from an early meeting between local aborigines and white settlers. When asked by the Europeans what these strange-looking animals were, a native replied \"kangaroo\", meaning \"I don't understand you.\"\nThe kangaroo is an individualistic animal. Although it does gather in groups, the kangaroo is not a herd animal. If a group is attacked, individuals run off in different directions.

According to a recent survey of 227 cities around the globe, you must go south of the equator   to Australia to find the priciest homes.\nThe report measured a city's housing market along the following guidelines. An \"affordable\" home required three times or less of the average family's income to purchase. At four times earnings, a home fell into the \"unaffordable\" category. And a \"seriously unaffordable\" home needed five times a family's income. In Australia, homes in the least affordable city cost just about 9.5 times the average income. Sydney, Perth, and Melbourne were only a little under this figure.\nAustralian officials offered little comment, apart from a general statement on the _ findings. These prices make the possibility that many Australians will one day own a home largely unbelievable. Land rationing   and excessive development charges have raised prices, and the problem will only be solved through urgent action by the Rudd government.\nSome American cities were also included on the least affordable list, four of which were in California. America is still involved in a mortgage crisis, though, affecting the affordability of homes. Yet a number of US cities garnered \"affordable\" status, namely Dallas and Kansas.

She attended Mount Holyoke Female Seminary in South Hadley, but only for one year. Throughout her life, she seldom left her home and visitors were few. The people with whom she did come in contact, however, had an enormous impact on her poetry. She was particularly stirred by the Reverend Charles Wadsworth, whom she first met on a trip to Philadelphia. While it is certain that he was an important figure in her life, it is not clear that their relationship was romantic--she called him \"my closest earthly friend.\" \nBy the 1860s, Dickinson lived in almost complete isolation from the outside world, but actively maintained many correspondences   and read widely. She spent a great deal of this time with her family. Her father, Edward Dickinson, was actively involved in state and national politics, serving in Congress for one term. Her brother, Austin, who attended law school and became an attorney  , lived next door with his wife, Susan Gilbert. Dickinson's younger sister, Lavinia, also lived at home for her entire life in similar isolation. Lavinia and Austin were not only family, but intellectual companions for Dickinson during her lifetime. \nWhile Dickinson was a prolific private poet, fewer than a dozen of her nearly eighteen hundred poems were published during her lifetime. Dickinson's poems are unique for the era in which she wrote; they contain short lines, typically lack titles, and often use slant rhyme as well as unconventional capitalization and punctuation. Many of her poems deal with themes of death and immortality, two recurring topics in letters to her friends.\nHer first collection of poetry was published in 1890. A complete and mostly unaltered collection of her poetry became available for the first time in 1955. Despite some unfavorable reviews and some skepticism during the late 19th and early 20th century as to Dickinson's literary techniques, she is now almost universally considered to be one of the most important American poets.", "id": "high18046.txt"}, {"answers": ["A", "B", "C", "A"], "options": [["sweet-meats and sweetbreads are different things", "there should be egg in an eggplant", "pineapples are the apples on the pine tree", "boxing rings should be round"], ["Beeth.", "Geese.", "Meese.", "Tooth."], ["A wise man and a wise guy.", "Overlook and oversee.", "Quite a lot and quite a few.", "Hot as hell and cold as hell."], ["clever", "crazy", "lazy", "Dull"]], "questions": ["According to the passage   _  .", "Which of the following is the correct plural?", "Which of the following includes two items which have the similar meaning?", "Through the many paradoxes in the English language, the writer wants to show that human beings are   _  ."], "article": "English is the most widely used language in the history of our planet.

Why are men and women are willing to suffer cold and hardship, and to take risks on high mountains? This astonishment is caused probably by the difference between mountaineering and other forms of activity to which men give their leisure.\nMountaineering is a sport, not a game. There are no man-made rules, as there are for such games as tennis and football. There are, of course, rules of a different kind which it would be dangerous to ignore, but it is this freedom from man-made rules that makes mountaineering attractive to many people. Those who climb mountains are free to use their own methods.\nIf we compare mountaineering and other more familiar sports, we might think that one big difference is that mountaineering is not a \"team sport\". Then we are mistaken in this. There are, it is true, no \"matches\" between \"teams\" of climbers, but when climbers are on a rock surface linked by a rope on which their lives may depend, there is obviously teamwork.\nA mountain climber knows that he may have to fight forces that are stronger and more powerful than man. He has to fight the forces of nature. This sport requires high mental and physical qualities.\nA mountain climber continues to improve his skills year after year.

The park is one of the few areas in Europe to hold the council's diploma for nature reserves of the highest quality, and Dr Baum had come to present it to the park once again. He was afraid that public opinion was turning against national parks, and that those set up in the 1960s and 1970s could not be set up today.

Since moving to Buffalo she's become a big hockey fan and has encouraged me to start watching it. Unfortunately it's very difficult to find hockey on television here in Alabama. Since hockey games don't air very much on television I've had to look for different ways to watch hockey games.\nI often see websites that claim if you go to their website you can watch television on your computer. I try out many of these websites hoping that one of the television stations is a northern station that airs hockey games. Unfortunately, most of them don't work. Either the site doesn't really give you what they advertise or their video player doesn't work properly. But finally I've found one website that actually works.\nFree Tube is a site that you can go to and watch Television online for free. You don't have to download any kind of special software or pay money or even sign up for anything. All you have to do is go to Free Tube, choose your channel and start watching.\nThe different channels to choose from are separated into different categories like news, business, entertainment, music and sports. You're not going to find channels like NBC or ABC so you can watch the latest episode of Heroes or Grey's Anatomy but it does include some popular channels like Cartoon Network and ESPN.\nThere is also a movie section. Each movie channel airs different sorts of films like adventure, classics, comedy or horror and that channel will always air that kind of movies. The movie section also includes my favorite station called Maxx Trailers  . Maxx Trailers airs nothing but movies trailers 24 hours a day. Some of the trailers are for movies coming out and some are for movies that have already been released but already released movies don't go back farther than a couple of months.\nSo far I haven't had any problems with Free Tube's video player either. Whenever I choose a channel, the video almost always works and usually loads every quickly. The only problem I have with Free Tube is that there is currently a _ if you're using Firefox. Once you choose a channel you can't select another channel to change to, your web browser will freeze up. So if you're using Firefox, the only way to switch channels is to leave the site and re-enter the site, when choosing what channel you want to go to. However, Free Tube is aware of this glitch and is working with Mozilla to get it fixed right away.\nIf you're missing some show everyone is talking about like Grey's Anatomy or Heroes, this isn't really a solution for that.

Electronic systems will start changing motorists for driving in cities.As soon as motorists have to pay to drive in cities, they will stop using their cars and use public transport instead.

Perhaps our worst mistake is believing that being thin means being loved, being special, and being cherished. We imagine what it will be like when we reach the long-awaited goal. We work very hard to realize this dream. Then, at last, we find ourselves there.\nBut we often gain back what we have lost. Even so, we continue to believe that next time it will be different. Next time, we will keep it off.

Beauty standards are different with culture. In Somoa a woman is not considered attractive unless she weighs more than 200 pounds. More importantly, if it's happiness that we want, why not put our energy there rather than on the size of our body? Why not look inside? Many of us try hard to change our body, but with no result.

While there are several standards for organic foods, foods must be grown without the use of antibiotics ,growth hormones ,chemical things and so on. The leaves of plants are one of the best choices.\nOn the other hand, natural foods have no legal rules, and are not controlled by any law. The USDA does require that seller should list the parts of natural foods, but there are no official rules for the amount of natural parts a food must contain. A natural food is usually considered to contain less chemical things, though there is no way to keep an eye on the product.\nThe USDA has guidelines for organic production. When considering buying organic foods, you must take into consideration that the organic meat, eggs and milk products must come from animals that are given no antibiotics or growth hormones.\nDue to higher labor costs, organic products cost 40% to 120% more compared with their natural foods.

Due to these rising statistics, families, communities and health care providers are at a cross-road in terms of how to best serve this growing aging population.\nMany elderly individuals choose to live alone, which causes a great risk as falls and other illnesses become more likely as a person ages. In order to increase the safety and security of an elderly person living alone, researchers are examining the use of through-the-wall radar technology to detect falls and monitor the elderly in their individual living spaces.\nGraduate students were trained in walking, falling, and functioning like an elderly person and experiments were conducted in the radar-imaging lab on the campus. A clinical instructor and an expert educated and trained the students on how the elderly carry themselves and walk--with or without the assistance of canes or walkers.\nTheir research focuses on various applications for radar imaging, including search and rescue, defense, and law enforcement. Dr Amin and his team, through a grant from Qatar University, are now developing a series of algorithms   to identify the patterns and routines of an elderly person in his or her home.\nThe radar, with the help of these algorithms, can detect when a person is sitting, standing, walking and so on.

Adults grow up to seven feet long, and weigh between 400 and 600 pounds. They can live as long as 30 years.\nThese seals are born on land. Every year, usually in May or June, females find sandy beaches and give birth to a single baby. The female seals avoid beaches where the water becomes deep very quickly because this lets sharks swim close to land and catch the seals.\nMothers stay with their babies for six weeks. During that entire time, they do not leave the beach even to eat. Instead, they live off fat that they have stored up over the previous year and feed their babies with fat-rich milk. After six weeks, mothers go back to the sea. The young have to live on their own.\nHuman disturbance  has been regarded as the important factor in the decrease of the monk seals. In fact, if human come too near a mother seal too often, she will go out to the sea. Unfortunately, this usually means death for the baby. It is now against the law for people to come within 100 yards of a seal on a beach.\nRecent research has shown that the decrease in the Hawaiian monk seal population is due to lack of survival of these seals at one of the most important breeding  beaches at French Frigate Shoals.

Clements pulls a ruler from a drawer and holds it up to Braga's hair in front near her face. \"Right here. An inch will be right here at your chin.\"\nClements was in this career for about 10 years before losing her vision. Now, when she begins cutting, it's easy to forget that Clements is completely blind. She carefully compares the length of each strand of hair. Though confident of her sense of touch, she at times asks her client to be her eyes and check her work.\nAfter a careful inspection, Braga gives her approval. And after Clements blows her hair dry, she remarks, \"You made me younger. I love it.\"\nClements had been doing Braga's hair for years before she became blind. Braga is proud to say she was Clements' first customer after she lost her vision.\n\"She sat me in the kitchen. It was dark, and she said ,' Are you ready?' I said, 'I'm ready.' And that is when she took this thing, and she said, ' Look and see if there is hair on the ground,' and I said ,' Yes, there is .' And she said, 'Okay, I have the right end of the thing.\" \nClements was 42 years old when she suffered a pulmonary embolism   that cost her sight. \"I was dead for 20 minutes first and then half an hour, and the lack of oxygen killed my optical  nerve.\" The last thing Clements remembered that day was the ambulance coming to get her. \"I couldn't breathe. The next thing I remembered was waking up three days later, blind, in the hospital.\"\nHer ribs had been broken, when they treated her. Her shoulder was dislocated. She had to undergo nine months of physical treatment.\n\"It was the hardest time in my life,\" she says. \"Everything changed in my life: distance, smell, and sound. My kids didn't sound the same. My husband didn't sound the same too. I didn't know my home. It took me three months to find the coffee table.\"\n Once a month, a teacher from the Virginia Center for the Blind came to her home in Woodbridge, about 40 kilometers from Washington. But Clements was eager to learn more. So in 2008, she left her husband and sons, to go to the Virginia School for the Blind in Richmond for a nine-month program. \"My plan was to be able to do for my family again, to do what I like to do, cook, clean, make phone calls.\"\n She learned basic skills like how to walk with a cane, how to listen and how to eat different foods. There were classes in Braille, computer skills and using different gadgets designed for the blind. Graduates of the program are expected to leave with not only life skills, but a marketable skill as well.\n\"My teacher asked me why I wouldn't do hair. I said, ' Hello. Blind. No, no, no.' I was scared  to think I could even do it.\"\nBut gradually, Clements gained confidence and by the time she graduated, had styled 100 heads of hair at the school. \"People from headquarters came, people from the library, students, secretaries, teachers, and friends came. Everybody came and let me do their hair,\" Clements says.\nThree days a week she leaves home to volunteer at the House of Mercy, a Catholic service organization that provides clothing, food and other support to the poor.\nKellie Ross, executive director of the House of Mercy, remembered when Clements first showed up with her friend, Kathy Braga, to offer her help.\nAt first, she had no idea Clements was blind. \"As she started to walk I realized she couldn't see, \" Ross recalls. \"She could have taken that tragic experience of losing her sight and gone inward, but instead she used that experience to help other people who are suffering.\"\nClements says she feels blessed to day, five years after her brush with death. \"I thank the Lord every day for my blindness, because I'm alive,\" she says. \"I could have been dead. I'm alive. I'm healthy, and that is what matters.\"", "id": "high21171.txt"}, {"answers": ["B", "C", "A", "D"], "options": [["It's of secondary importance to discipline.", "It's the basic but leading quality in one's life.", "It has the same requirements for people as discipline.", "It's the most important factor in building one's character."], ["can't achieve their goals in a short time", "can benefit from not growing up in the end", "can miss the advantages of being a responsible person", "can avoid the burdens of unpleasant or frightening things"], ["We should bear responsibility regardless of situations.", "We shouldn't owe failure to the sense of responsibility.", "We should first step out of our present circumstances.", "We shouldn't care what kind of situations we're in."], ["Because he had slipped on the water by chance.", "Because he had to mop up the water by himself.", "Because he didn't like the noise made in hospital.", "Because he found them refusing their responsibility."]], "questions": ["What can we learn about responsibility?", "Those who escape from accepting responsibility    .", "What does George Bernard Shaw's saying imply?", "Why was the patient quite angry with the nurse and the housekeeper?"], "article": "What is one of the most boring and tiresome words ever? Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.\nIt's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying\"It got lost\"to\"I lost it\". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.\nMany people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.\nGeorge Bernard Shaw once said,\"People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.\"\"Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,\"said Albert Schweitzer.\nThe following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.\nThe nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.\"It's not my responsibility,\"said the nurse,\"because it's a large puddle  .\"The housekeeper didn't agree.\"Well, it's not mine,\"she said,\"the puddle is too small.\"\nThe angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.\"Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?\"he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.\nSo, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent. If you want more control over your life and the pleasures, power of freedom and independence, all you have to do is be responsible.

I thought about recent taped television interviews that I had hated. I was afraid of what might happen.\nBut I also thought about the things that had gone right. I thought of how my speaking skills had improved over the past year. And then I thought of the book I was reading, a book that I had bought for $1.29 at the local store.

Written by Dr. David Schwartz, a professor at Georgia State University, the book contains dozens of practical tips on how to take risks to achieve big goals. Schwartz argues that nobody will believe in you until you believe in yourself.\nSo when the television producer asked if I wanted to appear on his show, I thought big. \"Sure,\" I said. \"I'll do it.\" I acted confidently, but on the inside I was frightened.

You can hum a song, daydream or think about nothing, leaving the real world behind you. But did you know that showering can also benefit your mind?\nA research by Scott Barry Kaufman, a psychologist from Yale University in the US interviewed over 3,000 people around the world. It turned out that nearly two-thirds of the interviewees said they had experienced new ideas in the shower and were more likely to have them in the shower than at work.\nSo why does a simple shower have such magic power? Science can explain it.\nShowering can help to raise our level of dopamine, a hormone   closely related to our creativity. \"People vary in terms of their level of creativity according to the activity of dopamine\", explained Alice Flaherty, a famous American neuroscientist. \"Taking a warm shower can make us feel relaxed and therefore make the dopamine level rise and bring 'Aha!' moment to us.\"\nBesides the chemical changes, showering may give you a break from what you feel you have been stuck with. Especially when you have thought hard all day about a problem, jumping into the shower can keep you from the outside world so that you can focus on your inner feelings and memories. In this way, according to American psychologist Shelley H. Carson, author ofYour Creative Brain, \"a showering hour may turn into an 'incubation   period' for your ideas.\"\nCompared with sitting in front of a computer, taking a shower is something we do less frequently in our daily life.

Older relatives, English teachers and the media always praise him. But when you actually take the time to read The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, you find that his work is more wonderful than you could've ever imagined.\nThe novel describes a young boy named Tom Sawyer growing up in a small town along the Mississippi River. He explores the countryside on a riverboat with his friends, falls in love with girls, starts secret clubs and searches for treasure. Twain's idea of childhood is magical - a time of imagination, wonder and, of course, adventure.\nMore importantly, through the eyes of Tom Sawyer, Twain cleverly makes fun of US culture. For example, Tom hates going to church, and Twain uses scenes of Tom there to _ religion   and its old traditions. \"Often, the less there is to justify a traditional custom, the harder it is to get rid of it,\" he writes in one chapter.\nTwain's writing is full of these kinds of critical   points about culture and politics. That's why he is so loved in the US - he wasn't afraid to state his opinions, and he did so clearly. For instance, Twain didn't like US wars abroad. In 1900, after the US invaded   the Philippines, Twain wrote in a newspaper article: \"We do not intend to free, but to subjugate   the people of the Philippines... We have gone there to conquer.\" He also believed strongly in women's right to vote in elections and gave a famous speech on the subject, called \"Votes for Women\", in 1901.\n\"Tom was a glittering hero once more - the pet of the old, the envy of the young,\" Twain writes in Tom Sawyer.

They may follow game inland for several hundred miles, but they always return to the shores of rivers, lakes, or seas. Eskimo land has a bare look. Large rocks, pebbles, and sand cover much of the surface. Plants called lichen   grow on the rocks, and where there is enough soil, grass, flowers, and even small bushes manage to live. No trees can grow on Eskimo land, so geographers sometimes call it the Arctic plains. There are some animals in Eskimo land, such as rabbits, which eat the plants. Other animals, like the white fox and the gray wolf, eat the rabbits. The Eskimo is a meat-eater, too, and may even eat a wolf when food is scarce.\nThe Eskimo year has two main parts: a long, cold winter and a short, cool summer. Spring and fall are almost too short to be noticed. Summer is the best time, as food is usually plentiful. But it is also the time when Eskimos are very busy. Winter is never far away, and the men must bring home extra meat for the women to prepare and store, for seldom can enough animals be killed in winter to feed a family.\nThe Far North is sometimes called the land of the midnight sun. This is true in the middle of summer, for between April 21st and August 21st the sun never sets in Northern Greenland. But in midwinter the Far North is a land with no sunshine at all. Around Oct. 21st the Eskimos of Northern Greenland see the sun set directly south of them, and they don't see it again until February 22nd. All places on earth get about the same amount of daylight during a year. As a result, if summer is lighter, winter has to be darker.\nWinter nights in the Far North are seldom _ .

EU documents must be translated into all these languages, and at official meetings the speeches must be translated into all the languages by interpreters.\nAll this translating is very expensive and time-consuming  . it is said that nearly half of all employees of the EU are engaged in translating documents and speeches, and nearly half of the EU's administrative  costs are spent on this task.

It is often' difficult to find people in the right place at the right time who can translate from (for example) Danish into Greek, or Dutch into Portuguese, at a high professional standard.\nIn practice the problem has been made less serious by the use of English in many contacts between EU officials, since almost all of them speak some English. However, any move to reduce the number of official languages (perhaps to four or five) would be a blow to the pride of the smaller countries.

However, there is quite a lot of evidence to suggest that this picture is far from being true. He seems to have been unusually thoughtful about the health and welfare of his men. For example he made sure that his crew got exercise, insisted on cleanliness on his ship, and adopted the practice of giving them a drink which prevented scurvy every day.\nWhen Captain Bligh arrived in Tahiti, it became clear that it would be some months before the breadfruit trees were ready to be taken to the West Indies. Instead of going off right away, he gave his crew extended shore leave. This may have been a mistake as many were unhappy about leaving when the time came. Finally, on the return journey the rebellion took place. The ship was under the command of the rebels and Captain Bligh had to leave in a small boat.\nCaptain Bligh's achievement was to get to dry land successfully. It is one of the supreme examples of seamanship. Apart from Bligh there were 18 members of his crew sailing in an open boat about 23 feet long and 7 feet wide. They took with them 25 gallons of water, 150 pounds of bread and 30 pounds of pork. They had no guns or other weapons. The boat was so low in the water that it seemed likely to sink at any time. On one occasion Captain Bligh tried to land on an island to get more water. He and his men were attacked by hostile natives and one of the crew was killed. At this point Bligh decided to sail directly to the Dutch settlement on the island of Timor without stopping. The distance was about 4,000 miles.

Most of us aren't trained to like confusion or to admit we feel hesitant and uncertain. In our schools and organizations, we place value on sounding certain and confident.\nAs life continues to speed up, I believe our changing world requires less certainty and far more curiosity. I'm not suggesting we let go of our beliefs, but that we become curious about what someone else believes. As we become open to the disturbing differences, sometimes we discover that another's way of interpreting the world is actually essential to our survival.\nFor me, the first step in becoming curious is to admit that I'm not succeeding in figuring things out by myself. If my solutions don't work as well as I'd like, I take these as signs that it's time to begin asking others what they think. I try to become a conscious listener, actively listening for differences.\nThere are many ways to listen for differences. Lately, I've been listening for what surprises me. This isn't easy -- I'm accustomed to sitting there, nodding my head as someone voices his opinions. But when I notice what surprises me, I'm able to see my own views more clearly, including my assumptions.\nIf you're willing to be disturbed and confused, I recommend you begin a conversation with someone who thinks differently from you. Listen for what's different and what surprises you. Try to stop the voice of judgment or opinion and just listen. At the end, notice whether you've learned something new.\nWe have the opportunity many times a day to be the one who listens to others and the one who is curious rather than certain. When we listen with fewer judgments, we always develop better relationships with each other. _ . Curiosity and good listening bring us back together.\nAs I consider partnering with confusion and uncertainty, I'm learning that we don't have to agree with each other in order to think well together.

The idea known as Lava Mae, is a response to the need of the homeless in the city.\nIt all started two years ago when Sandoval got in a cab after a meeting in the SoMa district of San Francisco, where the homeless mainly lived. \"My driver turned around and said, 'Welcome to the land of broken dreams.' \" Then Sandoval awoke from her imagination and started really look at the people around her. \" A woman I passed was crying and saying that she would never be clean\", Sandoval said. She took what the woman said as a sign that she should focus on the problem of hygiene , one of the most pressing needs for the homeless. \nAfter doing some research, Sandoval hit on the idea of a mobile unit that could be equipped with shower facilities. According to the company's founder Doniece Sandoval, every bus will be renewed and equipped with two separate private areas, each with a shower stall, sink, changing areas, toilet and bench. Sandoval says that if everyone sticks to a five-minute shower, a single Lava Mae bus could provide service for about 100 people during each 8- to 10-hour shift. \nThe project has been several years in the making as it has not been easy to get officials to agree. In addition, it is also difficult to ask the bus company to donate buses.

They also enjoy games that move in stages, in which each stage, the choosing of leaders, the picking-up of sides, or the determining of which side shall start, is almost a game in itself.\nGrown-ups can hardly find children's games exciting, and they often feel puzzled at why their kids play such simple games again and again.

He can be a good player without having to think whether he is a popular person, and he can find himself being a useful partner to someone of whom he is ordinarily afraid.

He can be confident, too, in particular games, that it is his place to give orders, to pretend to be dead, to throw a ball actually at someone, or to kiss someone he caught.\nIt appears to us that when children play a game they imagine a situation under their control.

The Parthenon was 60 feet high and was surrounded by 46 tall Doric columns. The temple was decorated with many sculptures. A continuous sculpture formed a border around the outside of the building. This horizontal band is called a frieze. Only 325 feet of the original 525 feet of the frieze still exist.

It was first a Greek temple. Then in the sixth century, Christians made it a church. Later, in the 1400s, Muslins used it as a mosque. At one point, it was nearly destroyed by war.

As Father said, if you just go driving without object, you have a sense of aimlessness, but if you are going to fish there is a definite purpose that heightens the enjoyment.\nSo we all felt it would be nicer for Mother to have a definite purpose . Father had just got a fishing rod the day before, which he said mother could use if she wanted to. Only Mother said she would much rather watch him fish than try to fish herself.\nSo we got her to make up a sandwich lunch in case we got hungry, though we were to come home again to a big festive dinner.\nWell, when the car came to the door, it turned out that there was not as much space in it as we had supposed. It was plain that we couldn't all get in.\nFather said that he could just stay home and put in the time working in the garden. He said that there was a lot of rough dirty work that he could do, like digging a trench for the garbage, which would save hiring a man, and so he said that he'd stay home; he said that we were not to let the fact that he had not had a real holiday for three years stand in our way. He wanted us to go right ahead and not to mind him.\nBut of course we all felt that it would never do to let Father stay home, especially as we knew he would make trouble if he did. The two girls, Anne and Mary, would have stayed and helped the maid get dinner, only it seemed such a pity,for the two girls were eager to show their new hats on a lovely day like this. But they said that Mother had only to say the word and they'd gladly stay home and work.

People kept interpreting her behavior as aggressive, but that was not right. Fairly soon she figured out what was happening.\nWhen most South Americans talk to each other face-to-face, they stand closer together than North Americans do. Martin had not readjusted to North American distances. Apparently, she had forgotten about the phenomenon known as personal space -- the amount of physical distance people expect during social interaction. Everyone has expectations concerning the use of personal space, but accepted distances for that space are determined by each person's culture.\nObservations about personal space began about twenty years ago. Anthropologist Edward T. Hall was a pioneer in the field. He became very interested in how interpersonal distances affected communication between people. In his book The Hidden Dimension, Hall invented the word \"proxemics\" to describe people's use of space as a means of communication. As Hall's book title indicates, most people are unconscious that interpersonal distances exist.\nPersonal space depends on invisible boundaries. Those boundaries move with people as they interact. Personal space gets larger or smaller depending on the circumstances of the social interaction at any moment. People do not like anyone to trespass   on their personal space. As Cooper explains, invasions of personal space bring about negative reactions.\nResearchers working with Hall's data found that accepted interpersonal distances in the United States also depend on other factors. For example, subcultures help determine expectations concerning personal space. Fisher, Bell, and Baum report that groups of Hispanic-Americans generally interact more closely within their subculture than Anglo-Americans do within theirs. They further explain that in general subcultural groups tend to interact at closer distances with members of their own subculture than with nonmembers.\nAge also affects how people use personal space. Cooper reports that North American children seem unaware of boundaries for personal space until the age of four or five. As the children get older they become more aware of standards for personal space. By the time they reach puberty  , they have completely adapted to their culture's standards for interpersonal distances.\nGender   also influences people's use of personal space. For example, North American males' most negative reaction is reserved for anyone who enters their personal space directly in front of them. Females, on the other hand, feel most negative about approaches from the side. Also, females have smaller interpersonal distances than males do, although pairs of the same sex communicate across larger spaces than do pairs of males and females. The gender factor changes, however, in high-density situations such as crowded subways or elevators in the United States. As Maines observes, when people have some choice about where they stand or sit in crowded settings, they choose people of the same sex.\nAs international travel and commerce increase, intercultural contact is becoming commonplace. Soon, perhaps, cultural differences in expectations for personal space will be as familiar to everyone as are cultural differences in food and dress. Until then, people need to make a special effort to learn one another's expectations concerning personal space. Once people are sensitive to such matters, they will not go either away from or toward a person from another culture.", "id": "high18574.txt"}, {"answers": ["B", "B"], "options": [["Time travel might become possible in the far future.", "Time machines can't travel to the past or the future without a wormhole.", "Sci-fi writers have similar experiences to those they describe in their fiction.", "An object can travel to the past or the future when its speed is faster than light."], ["To arouse the heated topic of time travel among readers.", "To introduce how humans travel through time in science fiction.", "To introduce the author's knowledge of time travel to the readers.", "To compare different ways of time travel mentioned in some science fictions."]], "questions": ["What can we learn from the passage?", "What is the author's purpose in writing this passage?"], "article": "Many of us are interested in time travel and shuttling back and forth   to the past or the future.

I have collected some of the popular ways in which time travel is made possible in science fiction:\n* Through the wormhole -- A wormhole is a path between points in space-time. According to Einstein, an object can pass through a wormhole if it can travel at the speed of light. An example of a wormhole is described in Riddle of the Red Bible.\n* Through a black hole -- A black hole is a vacuum   in space where light cannot even escape or pass through. In some sci-fi movies, like Star Trek, black holes became the means to travel through time.\n* Through time machines -- In science fiction, time machines are vehicles that can travel faster than light. It can be a strange vehicle like the TARDIS in Doctor Who or a special car like the one used in Back to the Future. But these special vehicles would need a wormhole to travel to the past or the future.\n* Through parallel universe   -- Another popular way to travel through time is to be able to get into a parallel universe where one can go back to a point in time and see a different reality.\nThough we know time travel may not be possible, it is still an entertaining subject and a heated topic for most of us.

It originated with the German physician Samuel Hahnemann (1755--1843). He came across the cinchona, the bark of a South American tree that was used by the local people to treat fevers. Among the active ingredients in the bark is quinine , which is still used to treat malaria. If a healthy person took cinchona, he or she would have symptoms   of malaria. In 1796 and 1810, Hahnemann published essays on the theories of homeopathy: substances that cause illnesses or symptoms in people can be used in small doses as treatment. Supporters of homeopathy viewed it as a safe, patient-centered system. Hahnemann claimed he could cure any and all illnesses using homeopathic principles.\nHowever, the Australian council sought to evaluate this claim once and for all. Their assessment was based on the analysis of 57 published systematic reviews encompassing 176 individual studies, independent evaluation of evidence provided by homeopathy interest groups and the public, and clinical practice guidelines and reports on homeopathy from other governments. Studies were only considered if they were case-controlled, meaning they compared a group of patients receiving homeopathic treatments with a control group. The council who oversaw this review consisted of experts in conventional-based medicine as well as complementary and alternative medicines. As a guideline, for a treatment to be considered effective, it must result in health improvements that cannot be explained by the placebo   effect, these improvements must be meaningful for a person's overall health and the results have to be seen consistently in several studies. A draft of the report was reviewed by a group of independent experts in complementary medicine research and opened up for public consultation before it was finalized.\nEventually, the council found no reliable evidence that homeopathic treatments were effective. Studies that did find homeopathy to be effective were overall of poor scientific quality, used too few patients or lacked evidence on which to base their conclusions. Rejecting proven medical treatments in favor of homeopathy for chronic or potentially serious conditions could place people at risk. As always, use of homeopathic or other remedies should be discussed with your physician in order to make informed healthcare decisions.", "id": "high19926.txt"}, {"answers": ["D", "D", "B"], "options": [["less challenging", "more unbelievable", "less noticeable", "more unsolvable"], ["It doesn't help cut food waste much.", "It causes much trouble for students.", "It isn't well-received by the freshmen.", "It is efficient for cutting food waste."], ["food waste has been a long-lasting chronic problem", "novel ways are being applied to cutting food waste", "colleges are truly the biggest source of food waste", "the \"It's okay to waste\" belief system is influential"]], "questions": ["High price of products makes the problem of food waste   _  .", "What does Caitlin Mewborn most probably think about the fact that no trays are provided in the campus' dining halls?", "The author mentions Virginia Tech as an example to support the idea that   _  ."], "article": "Food waste has been a chronic problem for restaurants and grocery stores -- with millions of tons lost along the way as crops are hauled hundreds of miles, stored for weeks in refrigerators and prepared on busy restaurant assembly lines.

We have instant satisfaction, fast food, speed reading, mobile phones; even the stress management books have titles like \"Stress Management in 60 Seconds\".\nCanadian Classics Professor Margaret Visser points out that the perception that we have \"no time\" is one of the most strict concepts of Western culture. Visser says that \"no time\" is used as an excuse and also as a spur ; it both stimulates us and forces us, just as a concept such as 'honour' did for the ancient Greeks. According to Visser, the feeling that Westerners have \"no time\" is abstract, quantitative, amoral , unarguable, bringing pressure on each person as an individual. At the same time, the \"no time\" excuse escapes\nby claiming to be a condition created entirely out of our good fortune.\nLife offers \"so many pleasures, so many choices\".\nThe fact that women now work outside the home has contributed to the \"no time\" trend. But more important, Visser says, is the fact that feeling rushed has become an important component  of our economy. Marketing of \"time-saving\" products causes people to buy more and work longer. So we eat out or buy prepared food to save time. The fax-it-to-my-car technology only contributes to the constant hurry. In our rushed and exhausted state, even the obligation  to sit down to casual meal with family seems like a pressure. In comparison with the decision to act on a sudden whimz   to consume a microwave mug of soup, the act of eating together and not getting up from the table until everyone else has finished seems an incredibly time-consuming event.

Supporters of advanced education for women faced many problems. States did require each town to provide a school for children, but teachers were often poorly prepared. Most young women were not able to continue on with their education in private schools. If they did, they often were not taught much except the French language, how to sew   clothing, and music.\nMary Lyon felt that women's education was extremely important. Through her lifelong work for education she became the most famous woman in the 19th century America. She believed that women were teachers both at home and in the classroom. And she believed that efforts to better educate young women also served God. If women were better educated, she felt, they could teach in local schools throughout the United States and in foreign countries.\nIn 1837, Mary Lyon opened Mount Holyoke Seminary for Women. Only four teachers and the first class of eighty young women lived and studied in the building when the school opened. But Mary knew the importance of what had been established   -- the first independent school for the higher education of women. The school continued to grow. In 1893, under a state law, Mount Holyoke Female Seminary became a college. Mount Holyoke College was the first college to offer women the same education as was offered to men.\nPeople who have studied Mary Lyon say she was not fighting a battle   of equality between men and women, yet she knew she wanted more for women.

The reason is simple: Rankings help them to attract students, staff and research investment.\nCurrently there are numbers of university rankings, and each has its own list of criteria. But the main categories are the same: academic reputation, graduates' performance and faculty resources.\nHowever, experts point out the ranking process isn't entirely reliable.

Back then, as well as today, providing food and security was the basic task for a person. However, nowadays the range of required goods has expanded significantly. People feel the need for not only some primary things, such as a piece of bread and a roof over their heads, but also for various facilities and luxuries. Providing humanity with these things is connected to the use of natural resources, which requires energy. In turn, the common sources of energy we use today cause pollution, so economic growth is almost unavoidably associated with environmental damage.\nEconomic growth is the increase in numbers of goods and services produced over time by an economy, and it is calculated in terms of real Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Before growth is calculated, inflation  is adjusted in order to take into account its misleading effect on the price of goods and services. Economic growth can also be explained as the increase in expected output, which results from an increase in actual output, or total demand.\nThere are certain aspects of economic growth which affect the environment. The first of these is the fact that in order to produce more goods and products, at a faster rate, the construction of large industrial plants is required. These plants produce a lot of waste, leading to the pollution of water and the atmosphere, which may cause negative long term health effects to nearby populations of animals, or people. _ also lead to global warming.\nIndustrial manufacturing leads to the constantly increasing energy consumption. The traditional energy sources, which are commonly used nowadays, are considered to be the greatest polluters to the environment. There also exist so-called eco-friendly sources of energy. They are sometimes preferred but replacing the traditional sources with them also requires time, during which people have to make some sacrifices to support these undertakings.\nIn order to produce economically practical energy, a sometimes significant transformation of the natural site is often inevitable. This is expensive and, has harmful effects on the environment. Application of wind energy would block airflows' natural speed which is the reason for their decrease in strength, after crossing the windmill. Consequently, the pressure balance that is brought about by this current will be affected, and it is important to remember that the environment and weather conditions are directly affected by atmospheric pressure.\nFor these reasons, bringing about economic growth without any resulting environmental damage, whatsoever, is impossible.", "id": "high3471.txt"}, {"answers": ["C", "D", "B", "A", "D"], "options": [["He filled his name on the Jax report quickly.", "Alex signed his name to the Jax report quickly.", "He offered the FMA president the Jax report smartly.", "He prepared the Jax report for Patterton to sign smartly."], ["SuNatCo would bring the stock market down if it sold all the Supranational stock they held.", "The president was stubborn and would never listen to others.", "Alex will take the place of Patterton in the future.", "the clients would take a bigger beating than the bank"], ["the old stock can be bought and sold", "shares can be bought and sold", "paper stock can be bought and sold", "some of the stock can be taken without being paid for"], ["free from danger", "short of wood", "running out of wood", "set free"], ["good leader of the U.S.A", "a good manager of a company", "headmaster", "banker, an indecisive sort of person"]], "questions": ["Alex filled him in quickly on the Jax report.

Now it is an ecological disaster area. Nauru's heartbreaking story could have one good consequence -- other countries might learn from its mistakes.\nFor thousands of years, Polynesian people lived the remote island of Nauru, far from western civilization. The first European to arrive was John Fearn in 1798. He was the British captain of the Hunter, a whaling ship. He called the island Pleasant Island.\nHowever, because it was very remote, Nauru had little communication with Europeans at first. The whaling ships and other traders began to visit, bringing guns and alcohol. These elements destroyed the social balance of the twelve family groups on the island. A ten-year civil war started, which reduced the population from 1,400 to 900.\nNauru's real troubles began in 1899 when a British mining company discovered phosphate  on the island. In fact, it found that the island of Nauru was nearly all phosphate, which a very important fertilizer for farming. The company began mining the phosphate.\nA phosphate mine is not a hole in the ground; it is a strip mine. When a company strip-mines, it removes the top layer of soil. Then it takes away the material it wants. Strip mining totally destroys the land. Gradually, the lovely island of Nauru started to look like the moon.\nIn 1968, Nauru became one of the richest countries in the world. Every year the government received millions and millions of dollars for its phosphate.\nUnfortunately, the leaders invested the money unwisely and lost millions of dollars. In addition, they used millions more dollars for personal expenses. Soon people realized that they had a terrible problem -- their phosphate was running out. Ninety percent of their island was destroyed and they had nothing. By 2000, Nauru was financially ruined. Experts say that it would take approximately $433,600,000 and more than 20 years to repair the island.

But using ambergris, which helps a perfume last longer, is strongly opposed by many people who think it is wrong to kill whales just so we can smell sweet. Joerg Bohlmann is neither a perfumer nor a whale expert. He's a plant biologist at the University of British Columbia in Canada. But his discovery of a new plant gene   might push whales out of the perfume business.\nThe gene comes from fir trees, found throughout North America and commonly used as Christmas trees. The trees produce a chemical that can be used in perfume in place of ambergris-but _ . \"There's a problem that many people wouldn't consider. In the tree, the chemical is mixed with many others. That makes separation a challenge,\" Bohlmann says. \"lt's like trying to isolate sugar from a biscuit. \"\nThis is where science becomes useful. When Bohlmann learned that fir trees produce the ambergris-like chemical, he decided to use his gene know-how to find the instructions for how to make the ambergris-substitute.\nBohlmann found that gene and took it out of the tree cells. Then he did something that might sound strange to someone who doesn't work in genetics: Bohlmann put the gene from the tree into yeast   cells.\nYeast may sound familiar because it's used to make things like bread, wine and beer. Biologists like to work with yeast because it easily adopts new genes and changes its features and behaviour. When Bohlmann put the fir tree gene into the yeast, the yeast started making the same chemical that had been produced by the tree.\nPerfumers pay big money for ambergris because it is a fixative, which means it holds a smell in place on a person's body.\n\"Cheap perfumes smell good in the first hour or so and then everything is gone,\" explains Bohlmann. \"But expensive perfumes are much more stable.  Their smell lasts much longer, for hours or even a day after you apply them. \"\nThe new chemical, made from the tree genes, can be used as a fixative, too. And using yeast to make it is far cheaper than acquiring ambergris.\nBohlmann admits he never thought he'd get into the perfume business.

There were so many shoes that people were setting up _ to try and match left and right shoes to sell or wear.\nEbbesmeyer found out in his researches that the shoes -- about 60,000 in total -- fell into the ocean in a shipping accident. He phoned the shoe company and asked if they wanted the shoes back. As expected, the company told him that they didn't. Ebbesmeyer realized this could be a great experiment. If he learned when and where the shoes went into the water and tracked where they landed, he could learn a lot about the patterns of ocean currents.\nThe Pacific Northwest is one of the world's best areas for beachcombing  because winds and currents join here, and as a result, there is a group of serious beachcombers in the area. Ebbesmeyer got to know a lot of them and asked for their help in collecting information about where the shoes landed. In a year he collected reliable information on 1, 600 shoes. With this data, he and a colleague were able to test and improve a computer program designed to model ocean currents, and publish the findings of their study.\nAs the result of his work, Ebbesmeyer has become known as the scientist to call with questions about any unusual objects found floating in the ocean. He has even started an association of beachcombers and ocean experts, with 500 subscribers from West Africa to New Zealand.

Barr Taylor, a professor of psychology at Stanford University.\n\"But while shyness can often be seen as a bad thing, there are ways to use the personality trait to your advantage,\" Taylor says. Below are some common shy habits and how you can learn to make them benefit you:\nShy people usually reflect inwardly   a lot. But according to Taylor,all that thinking may not always be a bad thing and it should be viewed as a way you can think actively as you go into a situation. So, for shy people who feel worried about facing a particular challenge or event, Taylor advises slowly approaching the fearful situation if you start to feel anxious. By facing what you are not feeling secure about, Taylor says, you will feel less anxious. \"Our brains are amazing--they can become well adapted,\" he says. \"If you put yourself in a fearful situation, you will get a sense that you are going to do it.\" What's more, shy individuals care deeply about what others think of them, and if it is addressed healthily, they can use it to their advantage to form social connections.\nShy people are observant and often pick up on parts of their conversation or surroundings that others may not. \"Just because you are shy, that does not mean you are not used to social situations,\" Taylor says. \"It can actually become a source of strength as you are the observer in the room.\" In a study out of Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, researchers found an association between college-age adults who were shy and the ability to better identify expressions of sadness and fear compared with those who weren't shy. In addition, a shy person has a born drive to absorb a conversation, so they can be great at conversation.", "id": "high12290.txt"}]
